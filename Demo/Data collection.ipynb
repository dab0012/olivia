    "In the case where the information is not available in dataset format or in some other way, web scraping becomes a useful tool to extract such information from web pages. However, it is important to note that the information extracted may not be accurate or out of date, and that the data extraction may be illegal or violate the privacy and security policies of the websites. Therefore, it is important to carefully assess the need and potential impact before taking any web scraping action."
