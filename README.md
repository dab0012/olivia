# **OLIVIA FINDER**
## Introduction
Olivia Finder is an open source tool that can be used to extract data from software package dependency networks in package managers. 

It is designed to work in conjunction with Olivia, and uses web-scraping techniques and CSV files as data sources. With Olivia Finder, you can easily extract information on package dependencies, versions, and other relevant data. This information can be used to analyze software packages and their dependencies, identify potential vulnerabilities or issues, and make informed decisions about which packages to use or avoid. Additionally, Olivia Finder is highly customizable and extensible, allowing you to tailor it to your specific needs and requirements.
