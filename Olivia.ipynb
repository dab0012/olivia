Due to the transitivity of dependencies, the appearance of a single defect in the repository can have extensive and difficult-to-predict effects on the ecosystem. These defects cause functional errors or performance or security problems. The risk is difficult to grasp for developers, who only explicitly import a small part of the dependencies.\n",
