      "The ability to efficiently represent and manipulate genomic annotations and alignments is playing a central role when it comes to analyzing high-throughput sequencing data (a.k.a. NGS data). The GenomicRanges package defines general purpose containers for storing and manipulating genomic intervals and variables defined along a genome. More specialized containers for representing and manipulating short alignments against a reference genome, or a matrix-like summarization of an experiment, are defined in the GenomicAlignments and SummarizedExperiment packages, respectively. Both packages build on top of the GenomicRanges infrastructure.\n",

In order to reduce memory usage and optimize performance, operations on the object are either delayed or executed using a block processing mechanism. Note that this also works on in-memory array-like objects like DataFrame objects (typically with Rle columns), Matrix objects, ordinary arrays and, data frames.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "The `BiocIO` package contains high-level abstract classes and generics used by developers to build IO funcionality within the Bioconductor suite of packages. Implements `import()` and `export()` standard generics for importing and exporting biological data formats. `import()` supports whole-file as well as chunk-wise iterative import. The `import()` interface optionally provides a standard mechanism for 'lazy' access via `filter()` (on row or element-like components of the file resource), `select()` (on column-like components of the file resource) and `collect()`. The `import()` interface optionally provides transparent access to remote (e.g. via https) as well as local access. Developers can register a file extension, e.g., `.loom` for dispatch from character-based URIs to specific `import()` / `export()` methods based on classes representing file types, e.g., `LoomFile()`.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "This package takes a list of p-values resulting from the simultaneous testing of many hypotheses and estimates their q-values and local FDR values. The q-value of a test measures the proportion of false positives incurred (called the false discovery rate) when that particular test is called significant. The local FDR measures the posterior probability the null hypothesis is true given the test's p-value. Various plots are automatically generated, allowing one to make sensible significance cut-offs. Several mathematical results have recently been shown on the conservative accuracy of the estimated q-values from this software. The software can be applied to problems in genomics, brain imaging, astrophysics, and data mining.\n",

      "Non-parametric bootstrap and permutation resampling-based multiple testing procedures (including empirical Bayes methods) for controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER), generalized family-wise error rate (gFWER), tail probability of the proportion of false positives (TPPFP), and false discovery rate (FDR). Several choices of bootstrap-based null distribution are implemented (centered, centered and scaled, quantile-transformed). Single-step and step-wise methods are available. Tests based on a variety of t- and F-statistics (including t-statistics based on regression parameters from linear and survival models as well as those based on correlation parameters) are included. When probing hypotheses with t-statistics, users may also select a potentially faster null distribution which is multivariate normal with mean zero and variance covariance matrix derived from the vector influence function. Results are reported in terms of adjusted p-values, confidence regions and test statistic cutoffs. The procedures are directly applicable to identifying differentially expressed genes in DNA microarray experiments.\n",

EnsDb databases built with ensembldb contain also protein annotations and mappings between proteins and their encoding transcripts. Finally, ensembldb provides functions to map between genomic, transcript and protein coordinates.\n",

      "The sva package contains functions for removing batch effects and other unwanted variation in high-throughput experiment. Specifically, the sva package contains functions for the identifying and building surrogate variables for high-dimensional data sets. Surrogate variables are covariates constructed directly from high-dimensional data (like gene expression/RNA sequencing/methylation/brain imaging data) that can be used in subsequent analyses to adjust for unknown, unmodeled, or latent sources of noise. The sva package can be used to remove artifacts in three ways: (1) identifying and estimating surrogate variables for unknown sources of variation in high-throughput experiments (Leek and Storey 2007 PLoS Genetics,2008 PNAS), (2) directly removing known batch effects using ComBat (Johnson et al. 2007 Biostatistics) and (3) removing batch effects with known control probes (Leek 2014 biorXiv). Removing batch effects and using surrogate variables in differential expression analysis have been shown to reduce dependence, stabilize error rate estimates, and improve reproducibility, see (Leek and Storey 2007 PLoS Genetics, 2008 PNAS or Leek et al. 2011 Nat. Reviews Genetics).\n",

      "The package implements a method for normalising microarray intensities from single- and multiple-color arrays. It can also be used for data from other technologies, as long as they have similar format. The method uses a robust variant of the maximum-likelihood estimator for an additive-multiplicative error model and affine calibration. The model incorporates data calibration step (a.k.a. normalization), a model for the dependence of the variance on the mean intensity and a variance stabilizing data transformation. Differences between transformed intensities are analogous to \"normalized log-ratios\". However, in contrast to the latter, their variance is independent of the mean, and they are usually more sensitive and specific in detecting differential transcription.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) is a non-parametric, unsupervised method for estimating variation of gene set enrichment through the samples of a expression data set. GSVA performs a change in coordinate systems, transforming the data from a gene by sample matrix to a gene-set by sample matrix, thereby allowing the evaluation of pathway enrichment for each sample. This new matrix of GSVA enrichment scores facilitates applying standard analytical methods like functional enrichment, survival analysis, clustering, CNV-pathway analysis or cross-tissue pathway analysis, in a pathway-centric manner.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Multivariate methods are well suited to large omics data sets where the number of variables (e.g. genes, proteins, metabolites) is much larger than the number of samples (patients, cells, mice). They have the appealing properties of reducing the dimension of the data by using instrumental variables (components), which are defined as combinations of all variables. Those components are then used to produce useful graphical outputs that enable better understanding of the relationships and correlation structures between the different data sets that are integrated. mixOmics offers a wide range of multivariate methods for the exploration and integration of biological datasets with a particular focus on variable selection. The package proposes several sparse multivariate models we have developed to identify the key variables that are highly correlated, and/or explain the biological outcome of interest. The data that can be analysed with mixOmics may come from high throughput sequencing technologies, such as omics data (transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, metagenomics etc) but also beyond the realm of omics (e.g. spectral imaging). The methods implemented in mixOmics can also handle missing values without having to delete entire rows with missing data. A non exhaustive list of methods include variants of generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis, sparse Partial Least Squares and sparse Discriminant Analysis. Recently we implemented integrative methods to combine multiple data sets: N-integration with variants of Generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis and P-integration with variants of multi-group Partial Least Squares.\n",

      "Monocle performs differential expression and time-series analysis for single-cell expression experiments. It orders individual cells according to progress through a biological process, without knowing ahead of time which genes define progress through that process. Monocle also performs differential expression analysis, clustering, visualization, and other useful tasks on single cell expression data. It is designed to work with RNA-Seq and qPCR data, but could be used with other types as well.\n",

      "The ggbio package extends and specializes the grammar of graphics for biological data. The graphics are designed to answer common scientific questions, in particular those often asked of high throughput genomics data. All core Bioconductor data structures are supported, where appropriate. The package supports detailed views of particular genomic regions, as well as genome-wide overviews. Supported overviews include ideograms and grand linear views. High-level plots include sequence fragment length, edge-linked interval to data view, mismatch pileup, and several splicing summaries.\n",

GDS is portable across platforms with hierarchical structure to store multiple scalable array-oriented data sets with metadata information. It is suited for large-scale datasets, especially for data which are much larger than the available random-access memory. The gdsfmt package offers the efficient operations specifically designed for integers of less than 8 bits, since a diploid genotype, like single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), usually occupies fewer bits than a byte. Data compression and decompression are available with relatively efficient random access. It is also allowed to read a GDS file in parallel with multiple R processes supported by the package parallel.\n",

      "AUCell allows to identify cells with active gene sets (e.g. signatures, gene modules...) in single-cell RNA-seq data. AUCell uses the \"Area Under the Curve\" (AUC) to calculate whether a critical subset of the input gene set is enriched within the expressed genes for each cell. The distribution of AUC scores across all the cells allows exploring the relative expression of the signature. Since the scoring method is ranking-based, AUCell is independent of the gene expression units and the normalization procedure. In addition, since the cells are evaluated individually, it can easily be applied to bigger datasets, subsetting the expression matrix if needed.\n",

      "Peak Detection in Mass Spectrometry data is one of the important preprocessing steps. The performance of peak detection affects subsequent processes, including protein identification, profile alignment and biomarker identification. Using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), this package provides a reliable algorithm for peak detection that does not require any type of smoothing or previous baseline correction method, providing more consistent results for different spectra.

      "Description:\n",
      "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to investigate the genetic basis of diseases and traits, but they pose many computational challenges. We developed an R package SNPRelate to provide a binary format for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in GWAS utilizing CoreArray Genomic Data Structure (GDS) data files. The GDS format offers the efficient operations specifically designed for integers with two bits, since a SNP could occupy only two bits. SNPRelate is also designed to accelerate two key computations on SNP data using parallel computing for multi-core symmetric multiprocessing computer architectures: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and relatedness analysis using Identity-By-Descent measures. The SNP GDS format is also used by the GWASTools package with the support of S4 classes and generic functions. The extended GDS format is implemented in the SeqArray package to support the storage of single nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertion/deletion polymorphism (indel) and structural variation calls in whole-genome and whole-exome variant data.\n",

Important features include a uniform workflow interface across different NGS applications, automated report generation, and support for running both R and command-line software, such as NGS aligners or peak/variant callers, on local computers or compute clusters. Efficient handling of complex sample sets and experimental designs is facilitated by a consistently implemented sample annotation infrastructure. Instructions for using systemPipeR are given in the Overview Vignette (HTML). The remaining Vignettes, linked below, are workflow templates for common NGS use cases.\n",

Slingshot was designed to model developmental trajectories in single-cell RNA sequencing data and serve as a component in an analysis pipeline after dimensionality reduction and clustering. It is flexible enough to handle arbitrarily many branching events and allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge through supervised graph construction.\n",

      "The MsFeature package defines functionality for Mass Spectrometry features. This includes functions to group (LC-MS) features based on some of their properties, such as retention time (coeluting features), or correlation of signals across samples. This packge hence allows to group features, and its results can be used as an input for the `QFeatures` package which allows to aggregate abundance levels of features within each group. This package defines concepts and functions for base and common data types, implementations for more specific data types are expected to be implemented in the respective packages (such as e.g. `xcms`). All functionality of this package is implemented in a modular way which allows combination of different grouping approaches and enables its re-use in other R packages.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a very powerful technique that has wide applicability in data science, bioinformatics, and further afield. It was initially developed to analyse large volumes of data in order to tease out the differences/relationships between the logical entities being analysed. It extracts the fundamental structure of the data without the need to build any model to represent it. This 'summary' of the data is arrived at through a process of reduction that can transform the large number of variables into a lesser number that are uncorrelated (i.e. the 'principal components'), while at the same time being capable of easy interpretation on the original data. PCAtools provides functions for data exploration via PCA, and allows the user to generate publication-ready figures. PCA is performed via BiocSingular - users can also identify optimal number of principal components via different metrics, such as elbow method and Horn's parallel analysis, which has relevance for data reduction in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and high dimensional mass cytometry data.\n",

In gage package, we provide functions for basic GAGE analysis, result processing and presentation. We have also built pipeline routines for of multiple GAGE analyses in a batch, comparison between parallel analyses, and combined analysis of heterogeneous data from different sources/studies. In addition, we provide demo microarray data and commonly used gene set data based on KEGG pathways and GO terms. These funtions and data are also useful for gene set analysis using other methods.\n",

      "Normalisation, testing for differential variability and differential methylation and gene set testing for data from Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation arrays. The normalisation procedure is subset-quantile within-array normalisation (SWAN), which allows Infinium I and II type probes on a single array to be normalised together. The test for differential variability is based on an empirical Bayes version of Levene's test. Differential methylation testing is performed using RUV, which can adjust for systematic errors of unknown origin in high-dimensional data by using negative control probes. Gene ontology analysis is performed by taking into account the number of probes per gene on the array, as well as taking into account multi-gene associated probes.\n",

      "RcisTarget identifies transcription factor binding motifs (TFBS) over-represented on a gene list. In a first step, RcisTarget selects DNA motifs that are significantly over-represented in the surroundings of the transcription start site (TSS) of the genes in the gene-set. This is achieved by using a database that contains genome-wide cross-species rankings for each motif. The motifs that are then annotated to TFs and those that have a high Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) are retained. Finally, for each motif and gene-set, RcisTarget predicts the candidate target genes (i.e. genes in the gene-set that are ranked above the leading edge).\n",

      "This package provides a flexible representation of copy number, mutation, and other data that fit into the ragged array schema for genomic location data. The basic representation of such data provides a rectangular flat table interface to the user with range information in the rows and samples/specimen in the columns. The RaggedExperiment class derives from a GRangesList representation and provides a semblance of a rectangular dataset.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Latent variable modeling with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) are powerful methods for visualization, regression, classification, and feature selection of omics data where the number of variables exceeds the number of samples and with multicollinearity among variables. Orthogonal Partial Least Squares (OPLS) enables to separately model the variation correlated (predictive) to the factor of interest and the uncorrelated (orthogonal) variation. While performing similarly to PLS, OPLS facilitates interpretation. Successful applications of these chemometrics techniques include spectroscopic data such as Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) in metabolomics and proteomics, but also transcriptomics data. In addition to scores, loadings and weights plots, the package provides metrics and graphics to determine the optimal number of components (e.g. with the R2 and Q2 coefficients), check the validity of the model by permutation testing, detect outliers, and perform feature selection (e.g. with Variable Importance in Projection or regression coefficients). The package can be accessed via a user interface on the Workflow4Metabolomics.org online resource for computational metabolomics (built upon the Galaxy environment).\n",

      "A differential abundance analysis for the comparison of two or more conditions. Useful for analyzing data from standard RNA-seq or meta-RNA-seq assays as well as selected and unselected values from in-vitro sequence selections. Uses a Dirichlet-multinomial model to infer abundance from counts, optimized for three or more experimental replicates. The method infers biological and sampling variation to calculate the expected false discovery rate, given the variation, based on a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and Welch's t-test (via aldex.ttest), a Kruskal-Wallis test (via aldex.kw), a generalized linear model (via aldex.glm), or a correlation test (via aldex.corr). All tests report p-values and Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-values. ALDEx2 also calculates expected standardized effect sizes for paired or unpaired study designs.\n",

      "A universal, user friendly, single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing visualization toolkit that allows highly customizable creation of color blindness friendly, publication-quality figures. dittoSeq accepts both SingleCellExperiment (SCE) and Seurat objects, as well as the import and usage, via conversion to an SCE, of SummarizedExperiment or DGEList bulk data. Visualizations include dimensionality reduction plots, heatmaps, scatterplots, percent composition or expression across groups, and more. Customizations range from size and title adjustments to automatic generation of annotations for heatmaps, overlay of trajectory analysis onto any dimensionality reduciton plot, hidden data overlay upon cursor hovering via ggplotly conversion, and many more. All with simple, discrete inputs. Color blindness friendliness is powered by legend adjustments (enlarged keys), and by allowing the use of shapes or letter-overlay in addition to the carefully selected dittoColors().\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "fastseg implements a very fast and efficient segmentation algorithm. It has similar functionality as DNACopy (Olshen and Venkatraman 2004), but is considerably faster and more flexible. fastseg can segment data from DNA microarrays and data from next generation sequencing for example to detect copy number segments. Further it can segment data from RNA microarrays like tiling arrays to identify transcripts. Most generally, it can segment data given as a matrix or as a vector. Various data formats can be used as input to fastseg like expression set objects for microarrays or GRanges for sequencing data. The segmentation criterion of fastseg is based on a statistical test in a Bayesian framework, namely the cyber t-test (Baldi 2001). The speed-up arises from the facts, that sampling is not necessary in for fastseg and that a dynamic programming approach is used for calculation of the segments' first and higher order moments.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "The association between a variable of interest (e.g. two groups) and the global pattern of a group of variables (e.g. a gene set) is tested via a global F-test. We give the following arguments in support of the GlobalAncova approach: After appropriate normalisation, gene-expression-data appear rather symmetrical and outliers are no real problem, so least squares should be rather robust. ANCOVA with interaction yields saturated data modelling e.g. different means per group and gene. Covariate adjustment can help to correct for possible selection bias. Variance homogeneity and uncorrelated residuals cannot be expected. Application of ordinary least squares gives unbiased, but no longer optimal estimates (Gauss-Markov-Aitken). Therefore, using the classical F-test is inappropriate, due to correlation. The test statistic however mirrors deviations from the null hypothesis. In combination with a permutation approach, empirical significance levels can be approximated. Alternatively, an approximation yields asymptotic p-values. The framework is generalized to groups of categorical variables or even mixed data by a likelihood ratio approach. Closed and hierarchical testing procedures are supported. This work was supported by the NGFN grant 01 GR 0459, BMBF, Germany and BMBF grant 01ZX1309B, Germany.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Independent hypothesis weighting (IHW) is a multiple testing procedure that increases power compared to the method of Benjamini and Hochberg by assigning data-driven weights to each hypothesis. The input to IHW is a two-column table of p-values and covariates. The covariate can be any continuous-valued or categorical variable that is thought to be informative on the statistical properties of each hypothesis test, while it is independent of the p-value under the null hypothesis.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Managing data from large scale projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for further analysis is an important and time consuming step for research projects. Several efforts, such as Firehose project, make TCGA pre-processed data publicly available via web services and data portals but it requires managing, downloading and preparing the data for following steps. We developed an open source and extensible R based data client for Firehose pre-processed data and demonstrated its use with sample case studies. Results showed that RTCGAToolbox could improve data management for researchers who are interested with TCGA data. In addition, it can be integrated with other analysis pipelines for following data analysis.\n",

Secondly, the generated clusters are used to predict outcomes of groups of individuals based on their distribution of observations in the different clusters. As certain clusters with separating information will be identified, and these clusters are defined by a sparse number of variables, this method can reduce the complexity of data, to only emphasize the data that actually matters.\n",

It requires tabular input (e.g. txt files) as generated by quantitative analysis softwares of raw mass spectrometry data, such as MaxQuant or IsobarQuant. Functions are provided for data preparation, filtering, variance normalization and imputation of missing values, as well as statistical testing of differentially enriched / expressed proteins. It also includes tools to check intermediate steps in the workflow, such as normalization and missing values imputation. Finally, visualization tools are provided to explore the results, including heatmap, volcano plot and barplot representations. For scientists with limited experience in R, the package also contains wrapper functions that entail the complete analysis workflow and generate a report. Even easier to use are the interactive Shiny apps that are provided by the package.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "LEA is an R package dedicated to population genomics, landscape genomics and genotype-environment association tests. LEA can run analyses of population structure and genome-wide tests for local adaptation, and also performs imputation of missing genotypes. The package includes statistical methods for estimating ancestry coefficients from large genotypic matrices and for evaluating the number of ancestral populations (snmf, pca). It performs statistical tests using latent factor mixed models for identifying genetic polymorphisms that exhibit association with environmental gradients or phenotypic traits (lfmm2). In addition, LEA computes values of genetic offset based on new or predicted environments. The package includes factor methods for estimating ancestry coefficients from large genotypic matrices and for evaluating the number of ancestral populations (snmf, pca). LEA is mainly based on optimized programs that can scale with the dimensions of large data sets.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Mutational processes leave characteristic footprints in genomic DNA. This package provides a comprehensive set of flexible functions that allows researchers to easily evaluate and visualize a multitude of mutational patterns in base substitution catalogues of e.g. healthy samples, tumour samples, or DNA-repair deficient cells. The package covers a wide range of patterns including: mutational signatures, transcriptional and replicative strand bias, lesion segregation, genomic distribution and association with genomic features, which are collectively meaningful for studying the activity of mutational processes. The package works with single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions (Indels), double base substitutions (DBSs) and larger multi base substitutions (MBSs). The package provides functionalities for both extracting mutational signatures de novo and determining the contribution of previously identified mutational signatures on a single sample level. MutationalPatterns integrates with common R genomic analysis workflows and allows easy association with (publicly available) annotation data.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "This package is an implementation the Quantitative Set Analysis for Gene Expression (QuSAGE) method described in (Yaari G. et al, Nucl Acids Res, 2013). This is a novel Gene Set Enrichment-type test, which is designed to provide a faster, more accurate, and easier to understand test for gene expression studies. qusage accounts for inter-gene correlations using the Variance Inflation Factor technique proposed by Wu et al. (Nucleic Acids Res, 2012). In addition, rather than simply evaluating the deviation from a null hypothesis with a single number (a P value), qusage quantifies gene set activity with a complete probability density function (PDF). From this PDF, P values and confidence intervals can be easily extracted. Preserving the PDF also allows for post-hoc analysis (e.g., pair-wise comparisons of gene set activity) while maintaining statistical traceability. Finally, while qusage is compatible with individual gene statistics from existing methods (e.g., LIMMA), a Welch-based method is implemented that is shown to improve specificity. The QuSAGE package also includes a mixed effects model implementation, as described in (Turner JA et al, BMC Bioinformatics, 2015), and a meta-analysis framework as described in (Meng H, et al. PLoS Comput Biol. 2019). For questions, contact Chris Bolen (cbolen1@gmail.com) or Steven Kleinstein (steven.kleinstein@yale.edu)\n",

However, finding data of interest can be challenging using current tools. SRAdb is an attempt to make access to the metadata associated with submission, study, sample, experiment and run much more feasible. This is accomplished by parsing all the NCBI SRA metadata into a SQLite database that can be stored and queried locally. Fulltext search in the package make querying metadata very flexible and powerful. fastq and sra files can be downloaded for doing alignment locally. Beside ftp protocol, the SRAdb has funcitons supporting fastp protocol (ascp from Aspera Connect) for faster downloading large data files over long distance. The SQLite database is updated regularly as new data is added to SRA and can be downloaded at will for the most up-to-date metadata.\n",

      "tradeSeq provides a flexible method for fitting regression models that can be used to find genes that are differentially expressed along one or multiple lineages in a trajectory. Based on the fitted models, it uses a variety of tests suited to answer different questions of interest, e.g. the discovery of genes for which expression is associated with pseudotime, or which are differentially expressed (in a specific region) along the trajectory. It fits a negative binomial generalized additive model (GAM) for each gene, and performs inference on the parameters of the GAM.\n",

      "A supra-hexagonal map is a giant hexagon on a 2-dimensional grid seamlessly consisting of smaller hexagons. It is supposed to train, analyse and visualise a high-dimensional omics input data. The supraHex is able to carry out gene clustering/meta-clustering and sample correlation, plus intuitive visualisations to facilitate exploratory analysis. More importantly, it allows for overlaying additional data onto the trained map to explore relations between input and additional data. So with supraHex, it is also possible to carry out multilayer omics data comparisons. Newly added utilities are advanced heatmap visualisation and tree-based analysis of sample relationships. Uniquely to this package, users can ultrafastly understand any tabular omics data, both scientifically and artistically, especially in a sample-specific fashion but without loss of information on large genes.\n",

      "ATAC-seq, an assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing, is a rapid and sensitive method for chromatin accessibility analysis. It was developed as an alternative method to MNase-seq, FAIRE-seq and DNAse-seq. Comparing to the other methods, ATAC-seq requires less amount of the biological samples and time to process. In the process of analyzing several ATAC-seq dataset produced in our labs, we learned some of the unique aspects of the quality assessment for ATAC-seq data.To help users to quickly assess whether their ATAC-seq experiment is successful, we developed ATACseqQC package partially following the guideline published in Nature Method 2013 (Greenleaf et al.), including diagnostic plot of fragment size distribution, proportion of mitochondria reads, nucleosome positioning pattern, and CTCF or other Transcript Factor footprints.\n",

      "The scde package implements a set of statistical methods for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data. scde fits individual error models for single-cell RNA-seq measurements. These models can then be used for assessment of differential expression between groups of cells, as well as other types of analysis. The scde package also contains the pagoda framework which applies pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis to identify and characterize putative cell subpopulations based on transcriptional signatures. The overall approach to the differential expression analysis is detailed in the following publication: \"Bayesian approach to single-cell differential expression analysis\" (Kharchenko PV, Silberstein L, Scadden DT, Nature Methods, doi: 10.1038/nmeth.2967). The overall approach to subpopulation identification and characterization is detailed in the following pre-print: \"Characterizing transcriptional heterogeneity through pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis\" (Fan J, Salathia N, Liu R, Kaeser G, Yung Y, Herman J, Kaper F, Fan JB, Zhang K, Chun J, and Kharchenko PV, Nature Methods, doi:10.1038/nmeth.3734).\n",

The current implementation provides functions to perform PC-AiR (Conomos et al., 2015, Gen Epi) and PC-Relate (Conomos et al., 2016, AJHG). PC-AiR performs a Principal Components Analysis on genome-wide SNP data for the detection of population structure in a sample that may contain known or cryptic relatedness. Unlike standard PCA, PC-AiR accounts for relatedness in the sample to provide accurate ancestry inference that is not confounded by family structure. PC-Relate uses ancestry representative principal components to adjust for population structure/ancestry and accurately estimate measures of recent genetic relatedness such as kinship coefficients, IBD sharing probabilities, and inbreeding coefficients. Additionally, functions are provided to perform efficient variance component estimation and mixed model association testing for both quantitative and binary phenotypes.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats) coupled with nuclease Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) screens represent a promising technology to systematically evaluate gene functions. Data analysis for CRISPR/Cas9 screens is a critical process that includes identifying screen hits and exploring biological functions for these hits in downstream analysis. We have previously developed two algorithms, MAGeCK and MAGeCK-VISPR, to analyze CRISPR/Cas9 screen data in various scenarios. These two algorithms allow users to perform quality control, read count generation and normalization, and calculate beta score to evaluate gene selection performance. In downstream analysis, the biological functional analysis is required for understanding biological functions of these identified genes with different screening purposes. Here, We developed MAGeCKFlute for supporting downstream analysis. MAGeCKFlute provides several strategies to remove potential biases within sgRNA-level read counts and gene-level beta scores. The downstream analysis with the package includes identifying essential, non-essential, and target-associated genes, and performing biological functional category analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and protein complex enrichment analysis of these genes. The package also visualizes genes in multiple ways to benefit users exploring screening data. Collectively, MAGeCKFlute enables accurate identification of essential, non-essential, and targeted genes, as well as their related biological functions. This vignette explains the use of the package and demonstrates typical workflows.\n",

Three databases of lncRNA-miRNA interactions including spongeScan, starBase, and miRcode, as well as three databases of mRNA-miRNA interactions including miRTarBase, starBase, and miRcode are incorporated into the package for ceRNAs network construction. limma, edgeR, and DESeq2 can be used to identify differentially expressed genes/miRNAs. Functional enrichment analyses including GO, KEGG, and DO can be performed based on the clusterProfiler and DO packages. Both univariate CoxPH and KM survival analyses of multiple genes can be implemented in the package. Besides some routine visualization functions such as volcano plot, bar plot, and KM plot, a few simply shiny apps are developed to facilitate visualization of results on a local webpage.\n",

      "DEsingle is an R package for differential expression (DE) analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. It defines and detects 3 types of differentially expressed genes between two groups of single cells, with regard to different expression status (DEs), differential expression abundance (DEa), and general differential expression (DEg). DEsingle employs Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model to estimate the proportion of real and dropout zeros and to define and detect the 3 types of DE genes. Results showed that DEsingle outperforms existing methods for scRNA-seq DE analysis, and can reveal different types of DE genes that are enriched in different biological functions.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "This package provides a series of functions for performing differential expression analysis from RNA-seq count data using robust normalization strategy (called DEGES). The basic idea of DEGES is that potential differentially expressed genes or transcripts (DEGs) among compared samples should be removed before data normalization to obtain a well-ranked gene list where true DEGs are top-ranked and non-DEGs are bottom ranked. This can be done by performing a multi-step normalization strategy (called DEGES for DEG elimination strategy). A major characteristic of TCC is to provide the robust normalization methods for several kinds of count data (two-group with or without replicates, multi-group/multi-factor, and so on) by virtue of the use of combinations of functions in depended packages.\n",

      "To date, a number of methods have been developed for microbiome marker discovery based on metagenomic profiles, e.g. LEfSe. However, all of these methods have its own advantages and disadvantages, and none of them is considered standard or universal. Moreover, different programs or softwares may be development using different programming languages, even in different operating systems. Here, we have developed an all-in-one R package microbiomeMarker that integrates commonly used differential analysis methods as well as three machine learning-based approaches, including Logistic regression, Random forest, and Support vector machine, to facilitate the identification of microbiome markers.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "The kallisto | bustools pipeline is a fast and modular set of tools to convert single cell RNA-seq reads in fastq files into gene count or transcript compatibility counts (TCC) matrices for downstream analysis. Central to this pipeline is the barcode, UMI, and set (BUS) file format. This package serves the following purposes: First, this package allows users to manipulate BUS format files as data frames in R and then convert them into gene count or TCC matrices. Furthermore, since R and Rcpp code is easier to handle than pure C++ code, users are encouraged to tweak the source code of this package to experiment with new uses of BUS format and different ways to convert the BUS file into gene count matrix. Second, this package can conveniently generate files required to generate gene count matrices for spliced and unspliced transcripts for RNA velocity. Here biotypes can be filtered and scaffolds and haplotypes can be removed, and the filtered transcriptome can be extracted and written to disk. Third, this package implements utility functions to get transcripts and associated genes required to convert BUS files to gene count matrices, to write the transcript to gene information in the format required by bustools, and to read output of bustools into R as sparses matrices.\n",

It also runs the tree down to produce a final ordered list of the elements. The non-parametric bootstrap allows one to estimate the probability that each element belongs to each cluster (fuzzy clustering).\n",

Proteins quantification by multiple peptides or PSMs are more accurate. DEqMS package is able to estimate different prior variances for proteins quantified by different number of PSMs/peptides, therefore acchieving better accuracy.

The resulting flexible MCSs (FMCSs) are often larger than strict MCSs, resulting in the identification of more common features in their source structures, as well as a higher sensitivity in finding compounds with weak structural similarities. The fmcsR package provides several utilities to use the FMCS algorithm for pairwise compound comparisons, structure similarity searching and clustering.\n",

GEOmetadb is simply a thin wrapper around the SQLite database along with associated documentation. Finally, the SQLite database is updated regularly as new data is added to GEO and can be downloaded at will for the most up-to-date metadata.

      "GOfuncR performs a gene ontology enrichment analysis based on the ontology enrichment software FUNC. GO-annotations are obtained from OrganismDb or OrgDb packages ('Homo.sapiens' by default); the GO-graph is included in the package and updated regularly (01-May-2021). GOfuncR provides the standard candidate vs. background enrichment analysis using the hypergeometric test, as well as three additional tests: (i) the Wilcoxon rank-sum test that is used when genes are ranked, (ii) a binomial test that is used when genes are associated with two counts and (iii) a Chi-square or Fisher's exact test that is used in cases when genes are associated with four counts. To correct for multiple testing and interdependency of the tests, family-wise error rates are computed based on random permutations of the gene-associated variables. GOfuncR also provides tools for exploring the ontology graph and the annotations, and options to take gene-length or spatial clustering of genes into account. It is also possible to provide custom gene coordinates, annotations and ontologies.\n",

      "Single-cell RNA-seq technologies enable high throughput gene expression measurement of individual cells, and allow the discovery of heterogeneity within cell populations. Measurement of cell-to-cell gene expression similarity is critical for the identification, visualization and analysis of cell populations. However, single-cell data introduce challenges to conventional measures of gene expression similarity because of the high level of noise, outliers and dropouts. We develop a novel similarity-learning framework, SIMLR (Single-cell Interpretation via Multi-kernel LeaRning), which learns an appropriate distance metric from the data for dimension reduction, clustering and visualization.\n",

The package supplies functions to convert BAM files into read count matrices or genomic ranges objects, which are the input objects for cn.mops. cn.mops models the depths of coverage across samples at each genomic position. Therefore, it does not suffer from read count biases along chromosomes. Using a Bayesian approach, cn.mops decomposes read variations across samples into integer copy numbers and noise by its mixture components and Poisson distributions, respectively. cn.mops guarantees a low FDR because wrong detections are indicated by high noise and filtered out. cn.mops is very fast and written in C++.\n",

      "This package contains methods for converting standard objects constructed by bioinformatics packages, especially those in Bioconductor, and converting them to tidy data. It thus serves as a complement to the broom package, and follows the same the tidy, augment, glance division of tidying methods. Tidying data makes it easy to recombine, reshape and visualize bioinformatics analyses.\n",

      "Highly multiplexed imaging acquires the single-cell expression of selected proteins in a spatially-resolved fashion. These measurements can be visualised across multiple length-scales. First, pixel-level intensities represent the spatial distributions of feature expression with highest resolution. Second, after segmentation, expression values or cell-level metadata (e.g. cell-type information) can be visualised on segmented cell areas. This package contains functions for the visualisation of multiplexed read-outs and cell-level information obtained by multiplexed imaging technologies. The main functions of this package allow 1. the visualisation of pixel-level information across multiple channels, 2. the display of cell-level information (expression and/or metadata) on segmentation masks and 3. gating and visualisation of single cells.\n",

      "Quick and straightforward visualization of read signal over genomic intervals is key for generating hypotheses from sequencing data sets (e.g. ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, bisulfite/methyl-seq). Many tools both inside and outside of R and Bioconductor are available to explore these types of data, and they typically start with a bigWig or BAM file and end with some representation of the signal (e.g. heatmap). profileplyr leverages many Bioconductor tools to allow for both flexibility and additional functionality in workflows that end with visualization of the read signal.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Implements the density-preserving modification to t-SNE and UMAP described by Narayan et al. (2020) . The non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques t-SNE and UMAP enable users to summarise complex high-dimensional sequencing data such as single cell RNAseq using lower dimensional representations. These lower dimensional representations enable the visualisation of discrete transcriptional states, as well as continuous trajectory (for example, in early development). However, these methods focus on the local neighbourhood structure of the data. In some cases, this results in misleading visualisations, where the density of cells in the low-dimensional embedding does not represent the transcriptional heterogeneity of data in the original high-dimensional space. den-SNE and densMAP aim to enable more accurate visual interpretation of high-dimensional datasets by producing lower-dimensional embeddings that accurately represent the heterogeneity of the original high-dimensional space, enabling the identification of homogeneous and heterogeneous cell states. This accuracy is accomplished by including in the optimisation process a term which considers the local density of points in the original high-dimensional space. This can help to create visualisations that are more representative of heterogeneity in the original high-dimensional space.\n",

A general \"a la carte\" workflow gives users the ability access to multiple methods for data importing, calculation of general QC metrics, doublet detection, ambient RNA estimation and removal, filtering, normalization, batch correction or integration, dimensionality reduction, 2-D embedding, clustering, marker detection, differential expression, cell type labeling, pathway analysis, and data exporting. Curated workflows can be used to run Seurat and Celda. Streamlined quality control can be performed on the command line using the SCTK-QC pipeline. Users can analyze their data using commands in the R console or by using an interactive Shiny Graphical User Interface (GUI). Specific analyses or entire workflows can be summarized and shared with comprehensive HTML reports generated by Rmarkdown. Additional documentation and vignettes can be found at camplab.net/sctk.\n",

HiCcompare operates on processed Hi-C data in the form of chromosome-specific chromatin interaction matrices. It accepts three-column tab-separated text files storing chromatin interaction matrices in a sparse matrix format which are available from several sources. HiCcompare is designed to give the user the ability to perform a comparative analysis on the 3-Dimensional structure of the genomes of cells in different biological states.`HiCcompare` differs from other packages that attempt to compare Hi-C data in that it works on processed data in chromatin interaction matrix format instead of pre-processed sequencing data. In addition, `HiCcompare` provides a non-parametric method for the joint normalization and removal of biases between two Hi-C datasets for the purpose of comparative analysis. `HiCcompare` also provides a simple yet robust method for detecting differences between Hi-C datasets.\n",

      "R package for analysis of transcript and translation features through manipulation of sequence data and NGS data like Ribo-Seq, RNA-Seq, TCP-Seq and CAGE. It is generalized in the sense that any transcript region can be analysed, as the name hints to it was made with investigation of ribosomal patterns over Open Reading Frames (ORFs) as it's primary use case. ORFik is extremely fast through use of C++, data.table and GenomicRanges. Package allows to reassign starts of the transcripts with the use of CAGE-Seq data, automatic shifting of RiboSeq reads, finding of Open Reading Frames for whole genomes and much more.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "The purpose of this package is to discover the genes that are differentially expressed between two conditions in RNA-seq experiments. Gene expression is measured in counts of transcripts and modeled with the Negative Binomial (NB) distribution using a shrinkage approach for dispersion estimation. The method of moment (MM) estimates for dispersion are shrunk towards an estimated target, which minimizes the average squared difference between the shrinkage estimates and the initial estimates. The exact per-gene probability under the NB model is calculated, and used to test the hypothesis that the expected expression of a gene in two conditions identically follow a NB distribution.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "The main objective of ViSEAGO package is to carry out a data mining of biological functions and establish links between genes involved in the study. We developed ViSEAGO in R to facilitate functional Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of complex experimental design with multiple comparisons of interest. It allows to study large-scale datasets together and visualize GO profiles to capture biological knowledge. The acronym stands for three major concepts of the analysis: Visualization, Semantic similarity and Enrichment Analysis of Gene Ontology. It provides access to the last current GO annotations, which are retrieved from one of NCBI EntrezGene, Ensembl or Uniprot databases for several species. Using available R packages and novel developments, ViSEAGO extends classical functional GO analysis to focus on functional coherence by aggregating closely related biological themes while studying multiple datasets at once. It provides both a synthetic and detailed view using interactive functionalities respecting the GO graph structure and ensuring functional coherence supplied by semantic similarity. ViSEAGO has been successfully applied on several datasets from different species with a variety of biological questions. Results can be easily shared between bioinformaticians and biologists, enhancing reporting capabilities while maintaining reproducibility.\n",

      "This package provides useful and efficient utilites for the analysis of high-resolution genomic data using standard Bioconductor methods and classes. BRGenomics is feature-rich and simplifies a number of post-alignment processing steps and data handling. Emphasis is on efficient analysis of multiple datasets, with support for normalization and blacklisting. Included are functions for: spike-in normalizing data; generating basepair-resolution readcounts and coverage data (e.g. for heatmaps); importing and processing bam files (e.g. for conversion to bigWig files); generating metaplots/metaprofiles (bootstrapped mean profiles) with confidence intervals; conveniently calling DESeq2 without using sample-blind estimates of genewise dispersion; among other features.\n",

      "Biclustering by \"Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition\" (FABIA). FABIA is a model-based technique for biclustering, that is clustering rows and columns simultaneously. Biclusters are found by factor analysis where both the factors and the loading matrix are sparse. FABIA is a multiplicative model that extracts linear dependencies between samples and feature patterns. It captures realistic non-Gaussian data distributions with heavy tails as observed in gene expression measurements. FABIA utilizes well understood model selection techniques like the EM algorithm and variational approaches and is embedded into a Bayesian framework. FABIA ranks biclusters according to their information content and separates spurious biclusters from true biclusters. The code is written in C.\n",

The cola package provides a general framework for subgroup classification by consensus partitioning. It has the following features: 1. It modularizes the consensus partitioning processes that various methods can be easily integrated. 2. It provides rich visualizations for interpreting the results. 3. It allows running multiple methods at the same time and provides functionalities to straightforward compare results. 4. It provides a new method to extract features which are more efficient to separate subgroups. 5. It automatically generates detailed reports for the complete analysis. 6. It allows applying consensus partitioning in a hierarchical manner.\n",

IPO (`Isotopologue Parameter Optimization`) is a parameter optimization tool that is applicable for different kinds of samples and liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry devices, fast and free of labeling steps. IPO uses natural, stable 13C isotopes to calculate a peak picking score. Retention time correction is optimized by minimizing the relative retention time differences within features and grouping parameters are optimized by maximizing the number of features showing exactly one peak from each injection of a pooled sample. The different parameter settings are achieved by design of experiment. The resulting scores are evaluated using response surface models.\n",

      "pipeFrame is an R package for building a componentized bioinformatics pipeline. Each step in this pipeline is wrapped in the framework, so the connection among steps is created seamlessly and automatically. Users could focus more on fine-tuning arguments rather than spending a lot of time on transforming file format, passing task outputs to task inputs or installing the dependencies. Componentized step elements can be customized into other new pipelines flexibly as well. This pipeline can be split into several important functional steps, so it is much easier for users to understand the complex arguments from each step rather than parameter combination from the whole pipeline. At the same time, componentized pipeline can restart at the breakpoint and avoid rerunning the whole pipeline, which may save a lot of time for users on pipeline tuning or such issues as power off or process other interrupts.\n",

      "Name: kebabs\n",
      "Description:\n",
      "The package provides functionality for kernel-based analysis of DNA, RNA, and amino acid sequences via SVM-based methods. As core functionality, kebabs implements following sequence kernels: spectrum kernel, mismatch kernel, gappy pair kernel, and motif kernel. Apart from an efficient implementation of standard position-independent functionality, the kernels are extended in a novel way to take the position of patterns into account for the similarity measure. Because of the flexibility of the kernel formulation, other kernels like the weighted degree kernel or the shifted weighted degree kernel with constant weighting of positions are included as special cases. An annotation-specific variant of the kernels uses annotation information placed along the sequence together with the patterns in the sequence. The package allows for the generation of a kernel matrix or an explicit feature representation in dense or sparse format for all available kernels which can be used with methods implemented in other R packages. With focus on SVM-based methods, kebabs provides a framework which simplifies the usage of existing SVM implementations in kernlab, e1071, and LiblineaR. Binary and multi-class classification as well as regression tasks can be used in a unified way without having to deal with the different functions, parameters, and formats of the selected SVM. As support for choosing hyperparameters, the package provides cross validation - including grouped cross validation, grid search and model selection functions. For easier biological interpretation of the results, the package computes feature weights for all SVMs and prediction profiles which show the contribution of individual sequence positions to the prediction result and indicate the relevance of sequence sections for the learning result and the underlying biological functions.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "MethylMix is an algorithm implemented to identify hyper and hypomethylated genes for a disease. MethylMix is based on a beta mixture model to identify methylation states and compares them with the normal DNA methylation state. MethylMix uses a novel statistic, the Differential Methylation value or DM-value defined as the difference of a methylation state with the normal methylation state. Finally, matched gene expression data is used to identify, besides differential, functional methylation states by focusing on methylation changes that effect gene expression. References: Gevaert 0.

      "Name: BASiCS\n",
      "Description:\n",
      "Single-cell mRNA sequencing can uncover novel cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression levels in seemingly homogeneous populations of cells. However, these experiments are prone to high levels of technical noise, creating new challenges for identifying genes that show genuine heterogeneous expression within the population of cells under study. BASiCS (Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell Sequencing data) is an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model to perform statistical analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets in the context of supervised experiments (where the groups of cells of interest are known a priori, e.g. experimental conditions or cell types). BASiCS performs built-in data normalisation (global scaling) and technical noise quantification (based on spike-in genes). BASiCS provides an intuitive detection criterion for highly (or lowly) variable genes within a single group of cells. Additionally, BASiCS can compare gene expression patterns between two or more pre-specified groups of cells. Unlike traditional differential expression tools, BASiCS quantifies changes in expression that lie beyond comparisons of means, also allowing the study of changes in cell-to-cell heterogeneity. The latter can be quantified via a biological over-dispersion parameter that measures the excess of variability that is observed with respect to Poisson sampling noise, after normalisation and technical noise removal. Due to the strong mean/over-dispersion confounding that is typically observed for scRNA-seq datasets, BASiCS also tests for changes in residual over-dispersion, defined by residual values with respect to a global mean/over-dispersion trend.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Sequencing and microarray samples often are collected or processed in multiple batches or at different times. This often produces technical biases that can lead to incorrect results in the downstream analysis. BatchQC is a software tool that streamlines batch preprocessing and evaluation by providing interactive diagnostics, visualizations, and statistical analyses to explore the extent to which batch variation impacts the data. BatchQC diagnostics help determine whether batch adjustment needs to be done, and how correction should be applied before proceeding with a downstream analysis. Moreover, BatchQC interactively applies multiple common batch effect approaches to the data, and the user can quickly see the benefits of each method. BatchQC is developed as a Shiny App. The output is organized into multiple tabs, and each tab features an important part of the batch effect analysis and visualization of the data. The BatchQC interface has the following analysis groups: Summary, Differential Expression, Median Correlations, Heatmaps, Circular Dendrogram, PCA Analysis, Shape, ComBat and SVA.\n",

      "The method performs bottom-up hierarchical clustering, using a Dirichlet Process (infinite mixture) to model uncertainty in the data and Bayesian model selection to decide at each step which clusters to merge. This avoids several limitations of traditional methods, for example how many clusters there should be and how to choose a principled distance metric. This implementation accepts multinomial (i.e. discrete, with 2+ categories) or time-series data. This version also includes a randomised algorithm which is more efficient for larger data sets.\n",

The last stage of SamSPECTRAL is to combine the spectral clusters. The resulting \"connected components\" estimate biological cell populations in the data. See the vignette for more details on how to use this package, some illustrations, and simple examples.\n",

      "Name: distinct\n",
      "Description:\n",
      "distinct is a statistical method to perform differential testing between two or more groups of distributions; differential testing is performed via hierarchical non-parametric permutation tests on the cumulative distribution functions (cdfs) of each sample. While most methods for differential expression target differences in the mean abundance between conditions, distinct, by comparing full cdfs, identifies, both, differential patterns involving changes in the mean, as well as more subtle variations that do not involve the mean (e.g., unimodal vs. bi-modal distributions with the same mean). distinct is a general and flexible tool: due to its fully non-parametric nature, which makes no assumptions on how the data was generated, it can be applied to a variety of datasets. It is particularly suitable to perform differential state analyses on single cell data (i.e., differential analyses within sub-populations of cells), such as single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and high-dimensional flow or mass cytometry (HDCyto) data. To use distinct one needs data from two or more groups of samples (i.e., experimental conditions), with at least 2 samples (i.e., biological replicates) per group.\n",

In addition the conversion from sequences to list like location information (and the reverse operation) is implemented as well.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "This R package supports the handling and analysis of imaging mass cytometry and other highly multiplexed imaging data. The main functionality includes reading in single-cell data after image segmentation and measurement, data formatting to perform channel spillover correction and a number of spatial analysis approaches. First, cell-cell interactions are detected via spatial graph construction; these graphs can be visualized with cells representing nodes and interactions representing edges. Furthermore, per cell, its direct neighbours are summarized to allow spatial clustering. Per image/grouping level, interactions between types of cells are counted, averaged and compared against random permutations. In that way, types of cells that interact more (attraction) or less (avoidance) frequently than expected by chance are detected.\n",

      "In a typical microarray setting with gene expression data observed under two conditions, the local false discovery rate describes the probability that a gene is not differentially expressed between the two conditions given its corrresponding observed score or p-value level. The resulting curve of p-values versus local false discovery rate offers an insight into the twilight zone between clear differential and clear non-differential gene expression. Package 'twilight' contains two main functions: Function twilight.pval performs a two-condition test on differences in means for a given input matrix or expression set and computes permutation based p-values. Function twilight performs a stochastic downhill search to estimate local false discovery rates and effect size distributions. The package further provides means to filter for permutations that describe the null distribution correctly. Using filtered permutations, the influence of hidden confounders could be diminished.\n",

By propagating uncertainty to downstream analyses we can improve results from microarray analyses. For the first time, the puma package makes a suite of uncertainty propagation methods available to a general audience. In additon to calculte gene expression from Affymetrix 3' arrays, puma also provides methods to process exon arrays and produces gene and isoform expression for alternative splicing study. puma also offers improvements in terms of scope and speed of execution over previously available uncertainty propagation methods. Included are summarisation, differential expression detection, clustering and PCA methods, together with useful plotting functions.\n",

The shearwater algorithm computes a Bayes classifier based on a beta-binomial model for variant calling with multiple samples for precisely estimating model parameters - such as local error rates and dispersion - and prior knowledge, e.g. from variation data bases such as COSMIC.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "The package contains methods to visualise the expression profile of genes from a microarray or RNA-seq experiment, and offers a supervised clustering approach to identify GO terms containing genes with expression levels that best classify two or more predefined groups of samples. Annotations for the genes present in the expression dataset may be obtained from Ensembl through the biomaRt package, if not provided by the user. The default random forest framework is used to evaluate the capacity of each gene to cluster samples according to the factor of interest. Finally, GO terms are scored by averaging the rank (alternatively, score) of their respective gene sets to cluster the samples. P-values may be computed to assess the significance of GO term ranking. Visualisation function include gene expression profile, gene ontology-based heatmaps, and hierarchical clustering of experimental samples using gene expression data.\n",

The ddCt package implements a pipeline to collect, analyse and visualize qRT-PCR results, for example those from TaqMan SDM software, mainly using the ddCt method. The pipeline can be either invoked by a script in command-line or through the API consisting of S4-Classes, methods and functions.\n",

      "glmSparseNet is an R-package that generalizes sparse regression models when the features (e.g. genes) have a graph structure (e.g. protein-protein interactions), by including network-based regularizers. glmSparseNet uses the glmnet R-package, by including centrality measures of the network as penalty weights in the regularization. The current version implements regularization based on node degree, i.e. the strength and/or number of its associated edges, either by promoting hubs in the solution or orphan genes in the solution. All the glmnet distribution families are supported, namely \"gaussian\", \"poisson\", \"binomial\", \"multinomial\", \"cox\", and \"mgaussian\".\n",

      "Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has made it possible to profile gene expression in tissues at high resolution. An important preprocessing step prior to performing downstream analyses is to identify and remove cells with poor or degraded sample quality using quality control (QC) metrics. Two widely used QC metrics to identify a âlow-qualityâ cell are (i) if the cell includes a high proportion of reads that map to mitochondrial DNA encoded genes (mtDNA) and (ii) if a small number of genes are detected. miQC is data-driven QC metric that jointly models both the proportion of reads mapping to mtDNA and the number of detected genes with mixture models in a probabilistic framework to predict the low-quality cells in a given dataset.\n",

MotifbreakR is both flexible and extensible over previous offerings; giving a choice of algorithms for interrogation of genomes with motifs from public sources that users can choose from; these are 1) a weighted-sum probability matrix, 2) log-probabilities, and 3) weighted by relative entropy. MotifbreakR can predict effects for novel or previously described variants in public databases, making it suitable for tasks beyond the scope of its original design. Lastly, it can be used to interrogate any genome curated within Bioconductor (currently there are 32 species, a total of 109 versions).\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "The TissueEnrich package is used to calculate enrichment of tissue-specific genes in a set of input genes. For example, the user can input the most highly expressed genes from RNA-Seq data, or gene co-expression modules to determine which tissue-specific genes are enriched in those datasets. Tissue-specific genes were defined by processing RNA-Seq data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) (UhlÃ©n et al. 2015), GTEx (Ardlie et al. 2015), and mouse ENCODE (Shen et al. 2012) using the algorithm from the HPA (UhlÃ©n et al. 2015).The hypergeometric test is being used to determine if the tissue-specific genes are enriched among the input genes. Along with tissue-specific gene enrichment, the TissueEnrich package can also be used to define tissue-specific genes from expression datasets provided by the user, which can then be used to calculate tissue-specific gene enrichments.\n",

      "pathwayPCA is an integrative analysis tool that implements the principal component analysis (PCA) based pathway analysis approaches described in Chen et al. (2008), Chen et al. (2010), and Chen (2011). pathwayPCA allows users to: (1) Test pathway association with binary, continuous, or survival phenotypes. (2) Extract relevant genes in the pathways using the SuperPCA and AES-PCA approaches. (3) Compute principal components (PCs) based on the selected genes. These estimated latent variables represent pathway activities for individual subjects, which can then be used to perform integrative pathway analysis, such as multi-omics analysis. (4) Extract relevant genes that drive pathway significance as well as data corresponding to these relevant genes for additional in-depth analysis. (5) Perform analyses with enhanced computational efficiency with parallel computing and enhanced data safety with S4-class data objects. (6) Analyze studies with complex experimental designs, with multiple covariates, and with interaction effects, e.g., testing whether pathway association with clinical phenotype is different between male and female subjects.

      "Methods and tools for (pre-)processing of metabolomics datasets (i.e. peak matrices), including filtering, normalisation, missing value imputation, scaling, and signal drift and batch effect correction methods. Filtering methods are based on: the fraction of missing values (across samples or features); Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) calculated from the Quality Control (QC) samples; the blank samples. Normalisation methods include Probabilistic Quotient Normalisation (PQN) and normalisation to total signal intensity. A unified user interface for several commonly used missing value imputation algorithms is also provided. Supported methods are: k-nearest neighbours (knn), random forests (rf), Bayesian PCA missing value estimator (bpca), mean or median value of the given feature and a constant small value. The generalised logarithm (glog) transformation algorithm is available to stabilise the variance across low and high intensity mass spectral features. Finally, this package provides an implementation of the Quality Control-Robust Spline Correction (QCRSC) algorithm for signal drift and batch effect correction of mass spectrometry-based datasets.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "cogena is a workflow for co-expressed gene-set enrichment analysis. It aims to discovery smaller scale, but highly correlated cellular events that may be of great biological relevance. A novel pipeline for drug discovery and drug repositioning based on the cogena workflow is proposed. Particularly, candidate drugs can be predicted based on the gene expression of disease-related data, or other similar drugs can be identified based on the gene expression of drug-related data. Moreover, the drug mode of action can be disclosed by the associated pathway analysis. In summary, cogena is a flexible workflow for various gene set enrichment analysis for co-expressed genes, with a focus on pathway/GO analysis and drug repositioning.\n",

By looking for regions of the genome which to which there are high densities of matches, we can infer a segmentation of the genome into regions of biological significance. The methods in this package allow the simultaneous segmentation of data from multiple samples, taking into account replicate data, in order to create a consensus segmentation. This has obvious applications in a number of classes of sequencing experiments, particularly in the discovery of small RNA loci and novel mRNA transcriptome discovery.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "BioNERO aims to integrate all aspects of biological network inference in a single package, including data preprocessing, exploratory analyses, network inference, and analyses for biological interpretations. BioNERO can be used to infer gene coexpression networks (GCNs) and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from gene expression data. Additionally, it can be used to explore topological properties of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. GCN inference relies on the popular WGCNA algorithm. GRN inference is based on the \"wisdom of the crowds\" principle, which consists in inferring GRNs with multiple algorithms (here, CLR, GENIE3 and ARACNE) and calculating the average rank for each interaction pair. As all steps of network analyses are included in this package, BioNERO makes users avoid having to learn the syntaxes of several packages and how to communicate between them. Finally, users can also identify consensus modules across independent expression sets and calculate intra and interspecies module preservation statistics between different networks.\n",

      "Name: esATAC\n",
      "Description:\n",
      "This package provides a framework and complete preset pipeline for quantification and analysis of ATAC-seq Reads. It covers raw sequencing reads preprocessing (FASTQ files), reads alignment (Rbowtie2), aligned reads file operations (SAM, BAM, and BED files), peak calling (F-seq), genome annotations (Motif, GO, SNP analysis) and quality control report. The package is managed by dataflow graph. It is easy for user to pass variables seamlessly between processes and understand the workflow. Users can process FASTQ files through end-to-end preset pipeline which produces a pretty HTML report for quality control and preliminary statistical results, or customize workflow starting from any intermediate stages with esATAC functions easily and flexibly.\n",

      "A collection of tools for cancer genomic data clustering analyses, including those for single cell RNA-seq. Cell clustering and feature gene selection analysis employ Bayesian (and maximum likelihood) non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm. Input data set consists of RNA count matrix, gene, and cell bar code annotations. Analysis outputs are factor matrices for multiple ranks and marginal likelihood values for each rank. The package includes utilities for downstream analyses, including meta-gene identification, visualization, and construction of rank-based trees for clusters.\n",

It builds on QFeature infrastructure for quantitative mass spectrometry data to store the model results together with the raw data and preprocessed data.\n",

      "`SPOTlight`provides a method to deconvolute spatial transcriptomics spots using a seeded NMF approach along with visualization tools to assess the results. Spatially resolved gene expression profiles are key to understand tissue organization and function. However, novel spatial transcriptomics (ST) profiling techniques lack single-cell resolution and require a combination with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) information to deconvolute the spatially indexed datasets. Leveraging the strengths of both data types, we developed SPOTlight, a computational tool that enables the integration of ST with scRNA-seq data to infer the location of cell types and states within a complex tissue. SPOTlight is centered around a seeded non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) regression, initialized using cell-type marker genes and non-negative least squares (NNLS) to subsequently deconvolute ST capture locations (spots).\n",

      "Fast functions for bipartite network rewiring through N consecutive switching steps (See References) and for the computation of the minimal number of switching steps to be performed in order to maximise the dissimilarity with respect to the original network. Includes functions for the analysis of the introduced randomness across the switching steps and several other routines to analyse the resulting networks and their natural projections. Extension to undirected networks and directed signed networks is also provided. Starting from version 1.9.7 a more precise bound (especially for small network) has been implemented. Starting from version 2.2.0 the analysis routine is more complete and a visual montioring of the underlying Markov Chain has been implemented. Starting from 3.6.0 the library can handle also matrices with NA (not for the directed signed graphs). Since version 3.27.1 it is possible to add a constraint for dsg generation: usually positive and negative arc between two nodes could be not accepted.\n",

      "Cell clustering is one of the most important and commonly performed tasks in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. An important step in cell clustering is to select a subset of genes (referred to as âfeaturesâ), whose expression patterns will then be used for downstream clustering. A good set of features should include the ones that distinguish different cell types, and the quality of such set could have significant impact on the clustering accuracy. FEAST is an R library for selecting most representative features before performing the core of scRNA-seq clustering. It can be used as a plug-in for the etablished clustering algorithms such as SC3, TSCAN, SHARP, SIMLR, and Seurat. The core of FEAST algorithm includes three steps: 1. consensus clustering; 2. gene-level significance inference; 3. validation of an optimized feature set.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "This package provides functions and routines for supervised analyses of mutational signatures (i.e., the signatures have to be known, cf. L. Alexandrov et al., Nature 2013 and L. Alexandrov et al., Bioaxiv 2018). In particular, the family of functions LCD (LCD = linear combination decomposition) can use optimal signature-specific cutoffs which takes care of different detectability of the different signatures. Moreover, the package provides different sets of mutational signatures, including the COSMIC and PCAWG SNV signatures and the PCAWG Indel signatures; the latter infering that with YAPSA, the concept of supervised analysis of mutational signatures is extended to Indel signatures. YAPSA also provides confidence intervals as computed by profile likelihoods and can perform signature analysis on a stratified mutational catalogue (SMC = stratify mutational catalogue) in order to analyze enrichment and depletion patterns for the signatures in different strata.\n",

The functions are implemented based on the algorithm of Yu and Liu, 2003 and Rajarshi Guha's implementation from 13/05/2005 available (as of 26/08/2018) at http://www.rguha.net/code/R/fcbf.R .\n",

The tool interactively performs survival, dimensionality reduction and median- and variance-based differential splicing and gene expression analyses that benefit from the incorporation of clinical and molecular sample-associated features (such as tumour stage or survival). Interactive visual access to genomic mapping and functional annotation of selected alternative splicing events is also included.\n",

The signatures are independent from the underlying platform, e.g., the input can be microarray or RNA Seq data. It can even infer the signatures using data from one platform, and evaluate them on the other. Pigengene identifies the modules (clusters) of highly coexpressed genes using coexpression network analysis, summarizes the biological information of each module in an eigengene, learns a Bayesian network that models the probabilistic dependencies between modules, and builds a decision tree based on the expression of eigengenes.\n",

      "Mixture Nested Effects Models (mnem) is an extension of Nested Effects Models and allows for the analysis of single cell perturbation data provided by methods like Perturb-Seq (Dixit et al., 2016) or Crop-Seq (Datlinger et al., 2017). In those experiments each of many cells is perturbed by a knock-down of a specific gene, i.e. several cells are perturbed by a knock-down of gene A, several by a knock-down of gene B, ... and so forth. The observed read-out has to be multi-trait and in the case of the Perturb-/Crop-Seq gene are expression profiles for each cell. mnem uses a mixture model to simultaneously cluster the cell population into k clusters and and infer k networks causally linking the perturbed genes for each cluster. The mixture components are inferred via an expectation maximization algorithm.\n",

It is also very fast and can be applied on whole-genome tiling array experiments quite easily with enough memory.\n",

      "Feature selection is critical in omics data analysis to extract restricted and meaningful molecular signatures from complex and high-dimension data, and to build robust classifiers. This package implements a new method to assess the relevance of the variables for the prediction performances of the classifier. The approach can be run in parallel with the PLS-DA, Random Forest, and SVM binary classifiers. The signatures and the corresponding 'restricted' models are returned, enabling future predictions on new datasets. A Galaxy implementation of the package is available within the Workflow4metabolomics.org online infrastructure for computational metabolomics.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "SCAN is a microarray normalization method to facilitate personalized-medicine workflows. Rather than processing microarray samples as groups, which can introduce biases and present logistical challenges, SCAN normalizes each sample individually by modeling and removing probe- and array-specific background noise using only data from within each array. SCAN can be applied to one-channel (e.g., Affymetrix) or two-channel (e.g., Agilent) microarrays. The Universal exPression Codes (UPC) method is an extension of SCAN that estimates whether a given gene/transcript is active above background levels in a given sample. The UPC method can be applied to one-channel or two-channel microarrays as well as to RNA-Seq read counts. Because UPC values are represented on the same scale and have an identical interpretation for each platform, they can be used for cross-platform data integration.\n",

The package provides parallel implementation of algorithms that process binary matrices where each row represents a tumor sample and each column a single-nucleotide or a structural variant driving the progression; a 0/1 value models the absence/presence of that alteration in the sample. The tool can import data from plain, MAF or GISTIC format files, and can fetch it from the cBioPortal for cancer genomics. Functions for data manipulation and visualization are provided, as well as functions to import/export such data to other bioinformatics tools for, e.g, clustering or detection of mutually exclusive alterations. Inferred models can be visualized and tested for their confidence via bootstrap and cross-validation. TRONCO is used for the implementation of the Pipeline for Cancer Inference (PICNIC).\n",

A series of functions enable the user to clean up the data by filtering genomic features and samples, to adjust data by identifying and removing the unwanted source of variation (i.e. batches and confounding factors) and to select the best predictors for modeling. Finally, a \"stacking\" ensemble learning technique is applied to build a robust classification model. Every step includes a checkpoint that the user may exploit to assess the effects of data management by looking at diagnostic plots, such as clustering and heatmaps, RLE boxplots, MDS or correlation plot.\n",

      "msPurity R package was developed to: 1) Assess the spectral quality of fragmentation spectra by evaluating the \"precursor ion purity\". 2) Process fragmentation spectra. 3) Perform spectral matching. What is precursor ion purity? -What we call \"Precursor ion purity\" is a measure of the contribution of a selected precursor peak in an isolation window used for fragmentation. The simple calculation involves dividing the intensity of the selected precursor peak by the total intensity of the isolation window. When assessing MS/MS spectra this calculation is done before and after the MS/MS scan of interest and the purity is interpolated at the recorded time of the MS/MS acquisition. Additionally, isotopic peaks can be removed, low abundance peaks are removed that are thought to have limited contribution to the resulting MS/MS spectra and the isolation efficiency of the mass spectrometer can be used to normalise the intensities used for the calculation.\n",

We integrate RNA-seq data with different types of prior knowledge to extract quantitative descriptors of the tumor microenvironment from several points of view, including composition of the immune repertoire, and activity of intra- and extra-cellular communications. Then, we use multi-task machine learning trained in TCGA data to identify how these descriptors can simultaneously predict several state-of-the-art hallmarks of anti-cancer immune response. In this way we derive cancer-specific models and identify cancer-specific systems biomarkers of immune response. These biomarkers have been experimentally validated in the literature and the performance of EaSIeR predictions has been validated using independent datasets form four different cancer types with patients treated with anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 therapy.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Interactions between proteins occur in many, if not most, biological processes. Most proteins perform their functions in networks associated with other proteins and other biomolecules. This fact has motivated the development of a variety of experimental methods for the identification of protein interactions. This variety has in turn ushered in the development of numerous different computational approaches for modeling and predicting protein interactions. Sometimes an experiment is aimed at identifying proteins closely related to some interesting proteins. A network based statistical learning method is used to infer the putative functions of proteins from the known functions of its neighboring proteins on a PPI network. This package identifies such proteins often involved in the same or similar biological functions.\n",

Unlike many other approaches, pqsfinder is able to detect G4s folded from imperfect G-runs containing bulges or mismatches or G4s having long loops. Pqsfinder also assigns an integer score to each hit that was fitted on G4 sequencing data and corresponds to expected stability of the folded G4.\n",

This panel was developed as part of the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP, http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/) of the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI). Thousands of compounds have been tested on the NCI-60, which have been extensively characterized by many platforms for gene and protein expression, copy number, mutation, and others (Reinhold, et al., 2012). The purpose of the CellMiner project (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/ cellminer) has been to integrate data from multiple platforms used to analyze the NCI-60 and to provide a powerful suite of tools for exploration of NCI-60 data.\n",

The toolbox includes pre-processing methods (e.g. signal drift and batch correction, normalisation, missing value imputation and scaling), univariate (e.g. ttest, various forms of ANOVA, KruskalâWallis test and more) and multivariate statistical methods (e.g. PCA and PLS, including cross-validation and permutation testing) as well as machine learning methods (e.g. Support Vector Machines). The STATistics Ontology (STATO) has been integrated and implemented to provide standardised definitions for the different methods, inputs and outputs.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Database search is the most widely used approach for peptide and protein identification in mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies. Our previous study showed that sample-specific protein databases derived from RNA-Seq data can better approximate the real protein pools in the samples and thus improve protein identification. More importantly, single nucleotide variations, short insertion and deletions and novel junctions identified from RNA-Seq data make protein database more complete and sample-specific. Here, we report an R package customProDB that enables the easy generation of customized databases from RNA-Seq data for proteomics search. This work bridges genomics and proteomics studies and facilitates cross-omics data integration.\n",

      "As transcription factors (TFs) play a crucial role in regulating the transcription process through binding on the genome alone or in a combinatorial manner, TF enrichment analysis is an efficient and important procedure to locate the candidate functional TFs from a set of experimentally defined regulatory regions. While it is commonly accepted that structurally related TFs may have similar binding preference to sequences (i.e. motifs) and one TF may have multiple motifs, TF enrichment analysis is much more challenging than motif enrichment analysis. Here we present a R package for TF enrichment analysis which combine motif enrichment with the PECA model.\n",

Several estimators have been developed to predict human aging from DNA level and RNA level. Most of the human transcriptional age predictor are based on microarray data and limited to only a few tissues. To date, transcriptional studies on aging using RNASeq data from different human tissues is limited. The aim of this package is to provide a tool for across-tissue and tissue-specific transcriptional age calculation based on GTEx RNASeq data.\n",

      "hiAnnotator contains set of functions which allow users to annotate a GRanges object with custom set of annotations. The basic philosophy of this package is to take two GRanges objects (query & subject) with common set of seqnames (i.e. chromosomes) and return associated annotation per seqnames and rows from the query matching seqnames and rows from the subject (i.e. genes or cpg islands). The package comes with three types of annotation functions which calculates if a position from query is: within a feature, near a feature, or count features in defined window sizes. Moreover, each function is equipped with parallel backend to utilize the foreach package. In addition, the package is equipped with wrapper functions, which finds appropriate columns needed to make a GRanges object from a common data frame.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods are typically unable to quantify the expression levels of all genes in a cell, creating a need for the computational prediction of missing values (âdropout imputationâ). Most existing dropout imputation methods are limited in the sense that they exclusively use the scRNA-seq dataset at hand and do not exploit external gene-gene relationship information. Here we propose two novel methods: a gene regulatory network-based approach using gene-gene relationships learnt from external data and a baseline approach corresponding to a sample-wide average. ADImpute can implement these novel methods and also combine them with existing imputation methods (currently supported: DrImpute, SAVER). ADImpute can learn the best performing method per gene and combine the results from different methods into an ensemble.\n",

      "This package provides the necessary functions for performing the Partial Correlation coefficient with Information Theory (PCIT) (Reverter and Chan 2008) and Regulatory Impact Factors (RIF) (Reverter et al. 2010) algorithm. The PCIT algorithm identifies meaningful correlations to define edges in a weighted network and can be applied to any correlation-based network including but not limited to gene co-expression networks, while the RIF algorithm identify critical Transcription Factors (TF) from gene expression data. These two algorithms when combined provide a very relevant layer of information for gene expression studies (Microarray, RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq data).\n",

      "Correspondence analysis (CA) is a matrix factorization method, and is similar to principal components analysis (PCA). Whereas PCA is designed for application to continuous, approximately normally distributed data, CA is appropriate for non-negative, count-based data that are in the same additive scale. The corral package implements CA for dimensionality reduction of a single matrix of single-cell data, as well as a multi-table adaptation of CA that leverages data-optimized scaling to align data generated from different sequencing platforms by projecting into a shared latent space. corral utilizes sparse matrices and a fast implementation of SVD, and can be called directly on Bioconductor objects (e.g., SingleCellExperiment) for easy pipeline integration. The package also includes additional options, including variations of CA to address overdispersion in count data, as well as the option to apply CA-style processing to continuous data (e.g., proteomic TOF intensities) with the Hellinger distance adaptation of CA.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Clustering is carried out to identify patterns in transcriptomics profiles to determine clinically relevant subgroups of patients. Feature (gene) selection is a critical and an integral part of the process. Currently, there are many feature selection and clustering methods to identify the relevant genes and perform clustering of samples. However, choosing an appropriate methodology is difficult. In addition, extensive feature selection methods have not been supported by the available packages. Hence, we developed an integrative R-package called multiClust that allows researchers to experiment with the choice of combination of methods for gene selection and clustering with ease. Using multiClust, we identified the best performing clustering methodology in the context of clinical outcome. Our observations demonstrate that simple methods such as variance-based ranking perform well on the majority of data sets, provided that the appropriate number of genes is selected. However, different gene ranking and selection methods remain relevant as no methodology works for all studies.\n",

      "TimeScape is an automated tool for navigating temporal clonal evolution data. The key attributes of this implementation involve the enumeration of clones, their evolutionary relationships and their shifting dynamics over time. TimeScape requires two inputs: (i) the clonal phylogeny and (ii) the clonal prevalences. Optionally, TimeScape accepts a data table of targeted mutations observed in each clone and their allele prevalences over time. The output is the TimeScape plot showing clonal prevalence vertically, time horizontally, and the plot height optionally encoding tumour volume during tumour-shrinking events. At each sampling time point (denoted by a faint white line), the height of each clone accurately reflects its proportionate prevalence. These prevalences form the anchors for bezier curves that visually represent the dynamic transitions between time points.\n",

      "Hipathia is a method for the computation of signal transduction along signaling pathways from transcriptomic data. The method is based on an iterative algorithm which is able to compute the signal intensity passing through the nodes of a network by taking into account the level of expression of each gene and the intensity of the signal arriving to it. It also provides a new approach to functional analysis allowing to compute the signal arriving to the functions annotated to each pathway.\n",

Such transcriptomic regions could be, for instance, signal peaks detected by CLIP-Seq analysis for protein-RNA interaction sites, RNA modification sites (alias the epitranscriptome), CAGE-tag locations, or any other collection of query regions at the level of the transcriptome. RCAS produces in-depth annotation summaries and coverage profiles based on the distribution of the query regions with respect to transcript features (exons, introns, 5'/3' UTR regions, exon-intron boundaries, promoter regions). Moreover, RCAS can carry out functional enrichment analyses and discriminative motif discovery.\n",

Additonally, due to the way that scDataviz is designed, which is based on SingleCellExperiment, it has a 'plug and play' feel, and immediately lends itself as flexibile and compatibile with studies that go beyond scDataviz. Finally, the graphics in scDataviz are generated via the ggplot engine, which means that users can 'add on' features to these with ease.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "QuaternaryProd is an R package that performs causal reasoning on biological networks, including publicly available networks such as STRINGdb. QuaternaryProd is an open-source alternative to commercial products such as Inginuity Pathway Analysis. For a given a set of differentially expressed genes, QuaternaryProd computes the significance of upstream regulators in the network by performing causal reasoning using the Quaternary Dot Product Scoring Statistic (Quaternary Statistic), Ternary Dot product Scoring Statistic (Ternary Statistic) and Fisher's exact test (Enrichment test). The Quaternary Statistic handles signed, unsigned and ambiguous edges in the network. Ambiguity arises when the direction of causality is unknown, or when the source node (e.g., a protein) has edges with conflicting signs for the same target gene. On the other hand, the Ternary Statistic provides causal reasoning using the signed and unambiguous edges only. The Vignette provides more details on the Quaternary Statistic and illustrates an example of how to perform causal reasoning using STRINGdb.\n",

      "Genome wide studies of translational control is emerging as a tool to study verious biological conditions. The output from such analysis is both the mRNA level (e.g. cytosolic mRNA level) and the levl of mRNA actively involved in translation (the actively translating mRNA level) for each mRNA. The standard analysis of such data strives towards identifying differential translational between two or more sample classes - i.e. differences in actively translated mRNA levels that are independent of underlying differences in cytosolic mRNA levels. This package allows for such analysis using partial variances and the random variance model. As 10s of thousands of mRNAs are analyzed in parallell the library performs a number of tests to assure that the data set is suitable for such analysis.\n",

External regulation evidences (TFBS, ChIP,...) can be integrated to assess the inferred network and refine it if necessary. Transcriptional activity of the regulators in the network can be estimated using an measure of their influence in a given sample. Finally, an interactive UI can be used to navigate through the network of cooperative regulators and to visualize their activity in a specific sample or subgroup sample. The proposed visualization tool can be used to integrate gene expression, transcriptional activity, copy number status, sample classification and a transcriptional network including co-regulation information.\n",

A key application is in identifing the genes targeted by a transcription factor of interest - that is, we collect genes that are associated with a ChIP-seq peak, and differential expression under some perturbation related to that TF.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "anota2seq provides analysis of translational efficiency and differential expression analysis for polysome-profiling and ribosome-profiling studies (two or more sample classes) quantified by RNA sequencing or DNA-microarray. Polysome-profiling and ribosome-profiling typically generate data for two RNA sources; translated mRNA and total mRNA. Analysis of differential expression is used to estimate changes within each RNA source (i.e. translated mRNA or total mRNA). Analysis of translational efficiency aims to identify changes in translation efficiency leading to altered protein levels that are independent of total mRNA levels (i.e. changes in translated mRNA that are independent of levels of total mRNA) or buffering, a mechanism regulating translational efficiency so that protein levels remain constant despite fluctuating total mRNA levels (i.e. changes in total mRNA that are independent of levels of translated mRNA). anota2seq applies analysis of partial variance and the random variance model to fulfill these tasks.\n",

      "BANDITS is a Bayesian hierarchical model for detecting differential splicing of genes and transcripts, via differential transcript usage (DTU), between two or more conditions. The method uses a Bayesian hierarchical framework, which allows for sample specific proportions in a Dirichlet-Multinomial model, and samples the allocation of fragments to the transcripts. Parameters are inferred via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and a DTU test is performed via a multivariate Wald test on the posterior densities for the average relative abundance of transcripts.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "The EMDomics algorithm is used to perform a supervised multi-class analysis to measure the magnitude and statistical significance of observed continuous genomics data between groups. Usually the data will be gene expression values from array-based or sequence-based experiments, but data from other types of experiments can also be analyzed (e.g. copy number variation). Traditional methods like Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) use significance tests based on summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) of the distributions. This approach lacks power to identify expression differences between groups that show high levels of intra-group heterogeneity. The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) algorithm instead computes the \"work\" needed to transform one distribution into another, thus providing a metric of the overall difference in shape between two distributions. Permutation of sample labels is used to generate q-values for the observed EMD scores. This package also incorporates the Komolgorov-Smirnov (K-S) test and the Cramer von Mises test (CVM), which are both common distribution comparison tests.\n",

      "This package produces metagene plots to compare coverages of sequencing experiments at selected groups of genomic regions. It can be used for such analyses as assessing the binding of DNA-interacting proteins at promoter regions or surveying antisense transcription over the length of a gene. The metagene2 package can manage all aspects of the analysis, from normalization of coverages to plot facetting according to experimental metadata. Bootstraping analysis is used to provide confidence intervals of per-sample mean coverages.\n",

The algorithm can be used to analyze data from either junction arrays (Affymetrix Arrays) or sequencing data (RNA-Seq). The software returns a data.frame with the detected alternative splicing events: gene name, type of event (cassette, alternative 3',...,etc), genomic position, statistical significance and increment of the percent spliced in (Delta PSI) for all the events. The algorithm can generate a series of files to visualize the detected alternative splicing events in IGV. This eases the interpretation of results and the design of primers for standard PCR validation.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) detects a large number of DNA methylation differences, often hundreds of differentially methylated regions and thousands of CpGs, that are significantly associated with a disease, many are located in non-coding regions. Therefore, there is a critical need to better understand the functional impact of these CpG methylations and to further prioritize the significant changes. MethReg is an R package for integrative modeling of DNA methylation, target gene expression and transcription factor binding sites data, to systematically identify and rank functional CpG methylations. MethReg evaluates, prioritizes and annotates CpG sites with high regulatory potential using matched methylation and gene expression data, along with external TF-target interaction databases based on manually curation, ChIP-seq experiments or gene regulatory network analysis.\n",

Using statistical models (including correlation, mutual information, regression and Bayes statistics) and quantitative data (intensity values of features) adjacency matrices are inferred that can be combined to a consensus matrix. Mass differences calculated between mass/charge values of features will be matched against a data frame of supplied mass/charge differences referring to transformations of enzymatic activities. In a third step, the two levels of information are combined to form a adjacency matrix inferred from both quantitative and structure information.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Functions for forward population genetic simulation in asexual populations, with special focus on cancer progression. Fitness can be an arbitrary function of genetic interactions between multiple genes or modules of genes, including epistasis, order restrictions in mutation accumulation, and order effects. Fitness (including just birth, just death, or both birth and death) can also be a function of the relative and absolute frequencies of other genotypes (i.e., frequency-dependent fitness). Mutation rates can differ between genes, and we can include mutator/antimutator genes (to model mutator phenotypes). Simulating multi-species scenarios and therapeutic interventions, including adaptive therapy, is also possible. Simulations use continuous-time models and can include driver and passenger genes and modules. Also included are functions for: simulating random DAGs of the type found in Oncogenetic Trees, Conjunctive Bayesian Networks, and other cancer progression models; plotting and sampling from single or multiple realizations of the simulations, including single-cell sampling; plotting the parent-child relationships of the clones; generating random fitness landscapes (Rough Mount Fuji, House of Cards, additive, NK, Ising, and Eggbox models) and plotting them.\n",

      "mistyR is an implementation of the Multiview Intercellular SpaTialmodeling framework (MISTy). MISTy is an explainable machine learning framework for knowledge extraction and analysis of single-cell, highly multiplexed, spatially resolved data. MISTy facilitates an in-depth understanding of marker interactions by profiling the intra- and intercellular relationships. MISTy is a flexible framework able to process a custom number of views. Each of these views can describe a different spatial context, i.e., define a relationship among the observed expressions of the markers, such as intracellular regulation or paracrine regulation, but also, the views can also capture cell-type specific relationships, capture relations between functional footprints or focus on relations between different anatomical regions. Each MISTy view is considered as a potential source of variability in the measured marker expressions. Each MISTy view is then analyzed for its contribution to the total expression of each marker and is explained in terms of the interactions with other measurements that led to the observed contribution.\n",

      "Name: mitch\n",
      "Description:\n",
      "mitch is an R package for multi-contrast enrichment analysis. At itâs heart, it uses a rank-MANOVA based statistical approach to detect sets of genes that exhibit enrichment in the multidimensional space as compared to the background. The rank-MANOVA concept dates to work by Cox and Mann (https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-13-S16-S12). mitch is useful for pathway analysis of profiling studies with one, two or more contrasts, or in studies with multiple omics profiling, for example proteomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic analysis of the same samples. mitch is perfectly suited for pathway level differential analysis of scRNA-seq data. The main strengths of mitch are that it can import datasets easily from many upstream tools and has advanced plotting features to visualise these enrichments.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Mutational signatures are carcinogenic exposures or aberrant cellular processes that can cause alterations to the genome. We created musicatk (MUtational SIgnature Comprehensive Analysis ToolKit) to address shortcomings in versatility and ease of use in other pre-existing computational tools. Although many different types of mutational data have been generated, current software packages do not have a flexible framework to allow users to mix and match different types of mutations in the mutational signature inference process. Musicatk enables users to count and combine multiple mutation types, including SBS, DBS, and indels. Musicatk calculates replication strand, transcription strand and combinations of these features along with discovery from unique and proprietary genomic feature associated with any mutation type. Musicatk also implements several methods for discovery of new signatures as well as methods to infer exposure given an existing set of signatures. Musicatk provides functions for visualization and downstream exploratory analysis including the ability to compare signatures between cohorts and find matching signatures in COSMIC V2 or COSMIC V3.\n",

For a given regulon, the 2-tailed GSEA approach computes a differential Enrichment Score (dES) for each individual sample, and the dES distribution of all samples is then used to assess the survival statistics for the cohort. There are two main survival analysis workflows: a Cox Proportional Hazards approach used to model regulons as predictors of survival time, and a Kaplan-Meier analysis assessing the stratification of a cohort based on the regulon activity. All plots can be fine-tuned to the user's specifications.\n",

      "The BloodGen3Module package provides functions for R user performing module repertoire analyses and generating fingerprint representations. Functions can perform group comparison or individual sample analysis and visualization by fingerprint grid plot or fingerprint heatmap. Module repertoire analyses typically involve determining the percentage of the constitutive genes for each module that are significantly increased or decreased. As we describe in details;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/525709v2 and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33624743/, the results of module repertoire analyses can be represented in a fingerprint format, where red and blue spots indicate increases or decreases in module activity. These spots are subsequently represented either on a grid, with each position being assigned to a given module, or in a heatmap where the samples are arranged in columns and the modules in rows.\n",

      "Data quality assessment is an integral part of preparatory data analysis to ensure sound biological information retrieval. We present here the MatrixQCvis package, which provides shiny-based interactive visualization of data quality metrics at the per-sample and per-feature level. It is broadly applicable to quantitative omics data types that come in matrix-like format (features x samples). It enables the detection of low-quality samples, drifts, outliers and batch effects in data sets. Visualizations include amongst others bar- and violin plots of the (count/intensity) values, mean vs standard deviation plots, MA plots, empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) plots, visualizations of the distances between samples, and multiple types of dimension reduction plots. Furthermore, MatrixQCvis allows for differential expression analysis based on the limma (moderated t-tests) and proDA (Wald tests) packages. MatrixQCvis builds upon the popular Bioconductor SummarizedExperiment S4 class and enables thus the facile integration into existing workflows. The package is especially tailored towards metabolomics and proteomics mass spectrometry data, but also allows to assess the data quality of other data types that can be represented in a SummarizedExperiment object.\n",

      "Name: MoonlightR\n",
      "Description:\n",
      "Motivation: The understanding of cancer mechanism requires the identification of genes playing a role in the development of the pathology and the characterization of their role (notably oncogenes and tumor suppressors). Results: We present an R/bioconductor package called MoonlightR which returns a list of candidate driver genes for specific cancer types on the basis of TCGA expression data. The method first infers gene regulatory networks and then carries out a functional enrichment analysis (FEA) (implementing an upstream regulator analysis, URA) to score the importance of well-known biological processes with respect to the studied cancer type. Eventually, by means of random forests, MoonlightR predicts two specific roles for the candidate driver genes: i) tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and ii) oncogenes (OCGs). As a consequence, this methodology does not only identify genes playing a dual role (e.g. TSG in one cancer type and OCG in another) but also helps in elucidating the biological processes underlying their specific roles. In particular, MoonlightR can be used to discover OCGs and TSGs in the same cancer type. This may help in answering the question whether some genes change role between early stages (I, II) and late stages (III, IV) in breast cancer. In the future, this analysis could be useful to determine the causes of different resistances to chemotherapeutic treatments.\n",

      "The package helps with the assessment and correction of RNA degradation effects in Affymetrix 3' expression arrays. The parameter d gives a robust and accurate measure of RNA integrity. The correction removes the probe positional bias, and thus improves comparability of samples that are affected by RNA degradation.\n",

      "LOBSTAHS is a multifunction package for screening, annotation, and putative identification of mass spectral features in large, HPLC-MS lipid datasets. In silico data for a wide range of lipids, oxidized lipids, and oxylipins can be generated from user-supplied structural criteria with a database generation function. LOBSTAHS then applies these databases to assign putative compound identities to features in any high-mass accuracy dataset that has been processed using xcms and CAMERA. Users can then apply a series of orthogonal screening criteria based on adduct ion formation patterns, chromatographic retention time, and other properties, to evaluate and assign confidence scores to this list of preliminary assignments. During the screening routine, LOBSTAHS rejects assignments that do not meet the specified criteria, identifies potential isomers and isobars, and assigns a variety of annotation codes to assist the user in evaluating the accuracy of each assignment.\n",

      "A sizable genomics study such as microarray often involves the use of multiple batches (groups) of experiment due to practical complication. To minimize batch effects, a careful experiment design should ensure the even distribution of biological groups and confounding factors across batches. OSAT (Optimal Sample Assignment Tool) is developed to facilitate the allocation of collected samples to different batches. With minimum steps, it produces setup that optimizes the even distribution of samples in groups of biological interest into different batches, reducing the confounding or correlation between batches and the biological variables of interest. It can also optimize the even distribution of confounding factors across batches. Our tool can handle challenging instances where incomplete and unbalanced sample collections are involved as well as ideal balanced RCBD. OSAT provides a number of predefined layout for some of the most commonly used genomics platform. Related paper can be find at http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/689 .\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "SCANVIS is a set of annotation-dependent tools for analyzing splice junctions and their read support as predetermined by an alignment tool of choice (for example, STAR aligner). SCANVIS assesses each junction's relative read support (RRS) by relating to the context of local split reads aligning to annotated transcripts. SCANVIS also annotates each splice junction by indicating whether the junction is supported by annotation or not, and if not, what type of junction it is (e.g. exon skipping, alternative 5' or 3' events, Novel Exons). Unannotated junctions are also futher annotated by indicating whether it induces a frame shift or not. SCANVIS includes a visualization function to generate static sashimi-style plots depicting relative read support and number of split reads using arc thickness and arc heights, making it easy for users to spot well-supported junctions. These plots also clearly delineate unannotated junctions from annotated ones using designated color schemes, and users can also highlight splice junctions of choice. Variants and/or a read profile are also incoroporated into the plot if the user supplies variants in bed format and/or the BAM file. One further feature of the visualization function is that users can submit multiple samples of a certain disease or cohort to generate a single plot - this occurs via a \"merge\" function wherein junction details over multiple samples are merged to generate a single sashimi plot, which is useful when contrasting cohorots (eg. disease vs control).\n",

      "systemPipeShiny (SPS) extends the widely used systemPipeR (SPR) workflow environment with a versatile graphical user interface provided by a Shiny App. This allows non-R users, such as experimentalists, to run many systemPipeRâs workflow designs, control, and visualization functionalities interactively without requiring knowledge of R. Most importantly, SPS has been designed as a general purpose framework for interacting with other R packages in an intuitive manner. Like most Shiny Apps, SPS can be used on both local computers as well as centralized server-based deployments that can be accessed remotely as a public web service for using SPRâs functionalities with community and/or private data. The framework can integrate many core packages from the R/Bioconductor ecosystem. Examples of SPSâ current functionalities include: (a) interactive creation of experimental designs and metadata using an easy to use tabular editor or file uploader; (b) visualization of workflow topologies combined with auto-generation of R Markdown preview for interactively designed workflows; (d) access to a wide range of data processing routines; (e) and an extendable set of visualization functionalities. Complex visual results can be managed on a 'Canvas Workbenchâ allowing users to organize and to compare plots in an efficient manner combined with a session snapshot feature to continue work at a later time. The present suite of pre-configured visualization examples. The modular design of SPR makes it easy to design custom functions without any knowledge of Shiny, as well as extending the environment in the future with contributions from the community.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Integrating an increasing number of available multi-omics cancer data remains one of the main challenges to improve our understanding of cancer. One of the main challenges is using multi-omics data for identifying novel cancer driver genes. We have developed an algorithm, called AMARETTO, that integrates copy number, DNA methylation and gene expression data to identify a set of driver genes by analyzing cancer samples and connects them to clusters of co-expressed genes, which we define as modules. We applied AMARETTO in a pancancer setting to identify cancer driver genes and their modules on multiple cancer sites. AMARETTO captures modules enriched in angiogenesis, cell cycle and EMT, and modules that accurately predict survival and molecular subtypes. This allows AMARETTO to identify novel cancer driver genes directing canonical cancer pathways.\n",

      "The CytoGLMM R package implements two multiple regression strategies: A bootstrapped generalized linear model (GLM) and a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Most current data analysis tools compare expressions across many computationally discovered cell types. CytoGLMM focuses on just one cell type. Our narrower field of application allows us to define a more specific statistical model with easier to control statistical guarantees. As a result, CytoGLMM finds differential proteins in flow and mass cytometry data while reducing biases arising from marker correlations and safeguarding against false discoveries induced by patient heterogeneity.\n",

      "In gene therapy, stem cells are modified using viral vectors to deliver the therapeutic transgene and replace functional properties since the genetic modification is stable and inherited in all cell progeny. The retrieval and mapping of the sequences flanking the virus-host DNA junctions allows the identification of insertion sites (IS), essential for monitoring the evolution of genetically modified cells in vivo. A comprehensive toolkit for the analysis of IS is required to foster clonal trackign studies and supporting the assessment of safety and long term efficacy in vivo. This package is aimed at (1) supporting automation of IS workflow, (2) performing base and advance analysis for IS tracking (clonal abundance, clonal expansions and statistics for insertional mutagenesis, etc.), (3) providing basic biology insights of transduced stem cells in vivo.\n",

      "Point mutations occurring in a genome can be divided into 96 categories based on the base being mutated, the base it is mutated into and its two flanking bases. Therefore, for any patient, it is possible to represent all the point mutations occurring in that patient's tumor as a vector of length 96, where each element represents the count of mutations for a given category in the patient. A mutational signature represents the pattern of mutations produced by a mutagen or mutagenic process inside the cell. Each signature can also be represented by a vector of length 96, where each element represents the probability that this particular mutagenic process generates a mutation of the 96 above mentioned categories. In this R package, we provide a set of functions to extract and visualize the mutational signatures that best explain the mutation counts of a large number of patients.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Metagenomic sequencing techniques enable quantitative analyses of the microbiome. However, combining the microbial data from these experiments is challenging due to the variations between experiments. The existing methods for correcting batch effects do not consider the interactions between variablesâmicrobial taxa in microbial studiesâand the overdispersion of the microbiome data. Therefore, they are not applicable to microbiome data. We develop a new method, Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial regression meta-analysis (BDMMA), to simultaneously model the batch effects and detect the microbial taxa associated with phenotypes. BDMMA automatically models the dependence among microbial taxa and is robust to the high dimensionality of the microbiome and their association sparsity.\n",

      "CellTrails is an unsupervised algorithm for the de novo chronological ordering, visualization and analysis of single-cell expression data. CellTrails makes use of a geometrically motivated concept of lower-dimensional manifold learning, which exhibits a multitude of virtues that counteract intrinsic noise of single cell data caused by drop-outs, technical variance, and redundancy of predictive variables. CellTrails enables the reconstruction of branching trajectories and provides an intuitive graphical representation of expression patterns along all branches simultaneously. It allows the user to define and infer the expression dynamics of individual and multiple pathways towards distinct phenotypes.\n",

      "Name: goSTAG\n",
      "Description:\n",
      "Gene lists derived from the results of genomic analyses are rich in biological information. For instance, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from a microarray or RNA-Seq analysis are related functionally in terms of their response to a treatment or condition. Gene lists can vary in size, up to several thousand genes, depending on the robustness of the perturbations or how widely different the conditions are biologically. Having a way to associate biological relatedness between hundreds and thousands of genes systematically is impractical by manually curating the annotation and function of each gene. Over-representation analysis (ORA) of genes was developed to identify biological themes. Given a Gene Ontology (GO) and an annotation of genes that indicate the categories each one fits into, significance of the over-representation of the genes within the ontological categories is determined by a Fisher's exact test or modeling according to a hypergeometric distribution. Comparing a small number of enriched biological categories for a few samples is manageable using Venn diagrams or other means for assessing overlaps. However, with hundreds of enriched categories and many samples, the comparisons are laborious. Furthermore, if there are enriched categories that are shared between samples, trying to represent a common theme across them is highly subjective. goSTAG uses GO subtrees to tag and annotate genes within a set. goSTAG visualizes the similarities between the over-representation of DEGs by clustering the p-values from the enrichment statistical tests and labels clusters with the GO term that has the most paths to the root within the subtree generated from all the GO terms in the cluster.\n",

      "Name: GSEAmining\n",
      "Description:\n",
      "Gene Set Enrichment Analysis is a very powerful and interesting computational method that allows an easy correlation between differential expressed genes and biological processes. Unfortunately, although it was designed to help researchers to interpret gene expression data it can generate huge amounts of results whose biological meaning can be difficult to interpret. Many available tools rely on the hierarchically structured Gene Ontology (GO) classification to reduce reundandcy in the results. However, due to the popularity of GSEA many more gene set collections, such as those in the Molecular Signatures Database are emerging. Since these collections are not organized as those in GO, their usage for GSEA do not always give a straightforward answer or, in other words, getting all the meaninful information can be challenging with the currently available tools. For these reasons, GSEAmining was born to be an easy tool to create reproducible reports to help researchers make biological sense of GSEA outputs. Given the results of GSEA, GSEAmining clusters the different gene sets collections based on the presence of the same genes in the leadind edge (core) subset. Leading edge subsets are those genes that contribute most to the enrichment score of each collection of genes or gene sets. For this reason, gene sets that participate in similar biological processes should share genes in common and in turn cluster together. After that, GSEAmining is able to identify and represent for each cluster: - The most enriched terms in the names of gene sets (as wordclouds) - The most enriched genes in the leading edge subsets (as bar plots). In each case, positive and negative enrichments are shown in different colors so it is easy to distinguish biological processes or genes that may be of interest in that particular study.\n",

Finally, the last objective of KnowSeq is the biological knowledge extraction from the biomarkers (Gene Ontology enrichment, Pathway listing and Visualization and Evidences related to the addressed disease). Although the package allows analyzing all the data manually, the main strenght of KnowSeq is the possibilty of carrying out an automatic and intelligent HTML report that collect all the involved steps in one document. It is important to highligh that the pipeline is totally modular and flexible, hence it can be started from whichever of the different steps. KnowSeq expects to serve as a novel tool to help to the experts in the field to acquire robust knowledge and conclusions for the data and diseases to study.\n",

      "This package provides pathway enrichment techniques for miRNA expression data. Specifically, the set of methods handles the many-to-many relationship between miRNAs and the multiple genes they are predicted to target (and thus affect.) It also handles the gene-to-pathway relationships separately. Both steps are designed to preserve the additive effects of miRNAs on genes, many miRNAs affecting one gene, one miRNA affecting multiple genes, or many miRNAs affecting many genes.\n",

      "Most human genes have multiple promoters that control the expression of different isoforms. The use of these alternative promoters enables the regulation of isoform expression pre-transcriptionally. Alternative promoters have been found to be important in a wide number of cell types and diseases. proActiv is an R package that enables the analysis of promoters from RNA-seq data. proActiv uses aligned reads as input, and generates counts and normalized promoter activity estimates for each annotated promoter. In particular, proActiv accepts junction files from TopHat2 or STAR or BAM files as inputs. These estimates can then be used to identify which promoter is active, which promoter is inactive, and which promoters change their activity across conditions. proActiv also allows visualization of promoter activity across conditions.\n",

      "DEGraph implements recent hypothesis testing methods which directly assess whether a particular gene network is differentially expressed between two conditions. This is to be contrasted with the more classical two-step approaches which first test individual genes, then test gene sets for enrichment in differentially expressed genes. These recent methods take into account the topology of the network to yield more powerful detection procedures. DEGraph provides methods to easily test all KEGG pathways for differential expression on any gene expression data set and tools to visualize the results.\n",

The different kinds of data are combined by an influence graph, which is a gene-gene interaction network deduced from pathway data. A greedy algorithm is used to find the possible driver genes, which may mutated in a larger number of patients and these mutations will push the gene expression values of the connected genes to some extreme values.\n",

      "GARFIELD is a non-parametric functional enrichment analysis approach described in the paper GARFIELD: GWAS analysis of regulatory or functional information enrichment with LD correction. Briefly, it is a method that leverages GWAS findings with regulatory or functional annotations (primarily from ENCODE and Roadmap epigenomics data) to find features relevant to a phenotype of interest. It performs greedy pruning of GWAS SNPs (LD r2 > 0.1) and then annotates them based on functional information overlap. Next, it quantifies Fold Enrichment (FE) at various GWAS significance cutoffs and assesses them by permutation testing, while matching for minor allele frequency, distance to nearest transcription start site and number of LD proxies (r2 > 0.8).\n",

Association testing can be performed whole-genome, whole-exome, or restricted to pre-defined regions of interest. The test is complemented by tools for analyzing and visualizing the results.\n",

A separate downstream analysis of phosphoproteomic data including pathway identification, transcription factor identification and target gene identification is opposed to the upstream analysis starting with gene or transcript information as basis for identification of upstream transcription factors and potential proteomic regulators. The cross-platform comparative analysis allows for comprehensive analysis of single time point experiments and time-series experiments by providing static and dynamic analysis tools for data integration. In addition, it provides functions to identify individual signaling axes based on data integration.\n",

The presence of intronic reads in GRO-seq type of data makes it possible to use it to computationally identify and quantify all de novo continuous regions of transcription distributed across the genome. This type of data, however, is more challenging to interpret and less common practice compared to mRNA-seq. One of the challenges for primary transcript detection concerns the simultaneous transcription of closely spaced genes, which needs to be properly divided into individually transcribed units. The R package transcriptR combines RNA-seq data with ChIP-seq data of histone modifications that mark active Transcription Start Sites (TSSs), such as, H3K4me3 or H3K9/14Ac to overcome this challenge. The advantage of this approach over the use of, for example, gene annotations is that this approach is data driven and therefore able to deal also with novel and case specific events. Furthermore, the integration of ChIP- and RNA-seq data allows the identification all known and novel active transcription start sites within a given sample.\n",

      "COCOA is a method for understanding epigenetic variation among samples. COCOA can be used with epigenetic data that includes genomic coordinates and an epigenetic signal, such as DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility data. To describe the method on a high level, COCOA quantifies inter-sample variation with either a supervised or unsupervised technique then uses a database of \"region sets\" to annotate the variation among samples. A region set is a set of genomic regions that share a biological annotation, for instance transcription factor (TF) binding regions, histone modification regions, or open chromatin regions. COCOA can identify region sets that are associated with epigenetic variation between samples and increase understanding of variation in your data.\n",

      "NuPoP is an R package for Nucleosome Positioning Prediction.This package is built upon a duration hidden Markov model proposed in Xi et al, 2010; Wang et al, 2008. The core of the package was written in Fotran. In addition to the R package, a stand-alone Fortran software tool is also available at https://github.com/jipingw. The Fortran codes have complete functonality as the R package. Note: NuPoP has two separate functions for prediction of nucleosome positioning, one for MNase-map trained models and the other for chemical map-trained models. The latter was implemented for four species including yeast, S.pombe, mouse and human, trained based on our recent publications. We noticed there is another package nuCpos by another group for prediction of nucleosome positioning trained with chemicals. A report to compare recent versions of NuPoP with nuCpos can be found at https://github.com/jiping/NuPoP_doc. Some more information can be found and will be posted at https://github.com/jipingw/NuPoP.\n",

      "Cell differentiation processes are achieved through a continuum of hierarchical intermediate cell-states that might be captured by single-cell RNA seq. Existing computational approaches for the assessment of cell-state hierarchies from single-cell data might be formalized under a general workflow composed of i) a metric to assess cell-to-cell similarities (combined or not with a dimensionality reduction step), and ii) a graph-building algorithm (optionally making use of a cells-clustering step). Sincell R package implements a methodological toolbox allowing flexible workflows under such framework. Furthermore, Sincell contributes new algorithms to provide cell-state hierarchies with statistical support while accounting for stochastic factors in single-cell RNA seq. Graphical representations and functional association tests are provided to interpret hierarchies.\n",

      "BiFET identifies TFs whose footprints are over-represented in target regions compared to background regions after correcting for the bias arising from the imbalance in read counts and GC contents between the target and background regions. For a given TF k, BiFET tests the null hypothesis that the target regions have the same probability of having footprints for the TF k as the background regions while correcting for the read count and GC content bias. For this, we use the number of target regions with footprints for TF k, t_k as a test statistic and calculate the p-value as the probability of observing t_k or more target regions with footprints under the null hypothesis.\n",

      "DEsubs is a network-based systems biology package that extracts disease-perturbed subpathways within a pathway network as recorded by RNA-seq experiments. It contains an extensive and customizable framework covering a broad range of operation modes at all stages of the subpathway analysis, enabling a case-specific approach. The operation modes refer to the pathway network construction and processing, the subpathway extraction, visualization and enrichment analysis with regard to various biological and pharmacological features. Its capabilities render it a tool-guide for both the modeler and experimentalist for the identification of more robust systems-level biomarkers for complex diseases.\n",

      "Many two-colour hybridizations suffer from a dye bias that is both gene-specific and slide-specific. The former depends on the content of the nucleotide used for labeling; the latter depends on the labeling percentage. The slide-dependency was hitherto not recognized, and made addressing the artefact impossible. Given a reasonable number of dye-swapped pairs of hybridizations, or of same vs. same hybridizations, both the gene- and slide-biases can be estimated and corrected using the GASSCO method (Margaritis et al., Mol. Sys. Biol. 5:266 (2009), doi:10.1038/msb.2009.21)\n",

      "This package facilitates analysis of both timecourse and steady state flow cytometry experiments. This package was originially developed for quantifying the function of gene regulatory networks in yeast (strain W303) expressing fluorescent reporter proteins using BD Accuri C6 and SORP cytometers. However, the functions are for the most part general and may be adapted for analysis of other organisms using other flow cytometers. Functions in this package facilitate the annotation of flow cytometry data with experimental metadata, as often required for publication and general ease-of-reuse. Functions for creating, saving and loading gate sets are also included. In the past, we have typically generated summary statistics for each flowset for each timepoint and then annotated and analyzed these summary statistics. This method loses a great deal of the power that comes from the large amounts of individual cell data generated in flow cytometry, by essentially collapsing this data into a bulk measurement after subsetting. In addition to these summary functions, this package also contains functions to facilitate annotation and analysis of steady-state or time-lapse data utilizing all of the data collected from the thousands of individual cells in each sample.\n",

However, many methods are devised for analyzing individual genes. It is said that techniques based on biological networks such as gene co-expression are more precise ways to represent information than those using lists of genes only. This package is aimed to integrate the gene expression and biological network. A biological network is constructed from gene expression data and it is used for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "While some non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are assigned critical regulatory roles, most remain functionally uncharacterized. This presents a challenge whenever an interesting set of ncRNAs needs to be analyzed in a functional context. Transcripts located close-by on the genome are often regulated together. This genomic proximity on the sequence can hint to a functional association. We present a tool, NoRCE, that performs cis enrichment analysis for a given set of ncRNAs. Enrichment is carried out using the functional annotations of the coding genes located proximal to the input ncRNAs. Other biologically relevant information such as topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries, co-expression patterns, and miRNA target prediction information can be incorporated to conduct a richer enrichment analysis. To this end, NoRCE includes several relevant datasets as part of its data repository, including cell-line specific TAD boundaries, functional gene sets, and expression data for coding & ncRNAs specific to cancer. Additionally, the users can utilize custom data files in their investigation. Enrichment results can be retrieved in a tabular format or visualized in several different ways. NoRCE is currently available for the following species: human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruit fly, worm, and yeast.\n",

      "scCB2 is an R package implementing CB2 for distinguishing real cells from empty droplets in droplet-based single cell RNA-seq experiments (especially for 10x Chromium). It is based on clustering similar barcodes and calculating Monte-Carlo p-value for each cluster to test against background distribution. This cluster-level test outperforms single-barcode-level tests in dealing with low count barcodes and homogeneous sequencing library, while keeping FDR well controlled.\n",

      "Name: SCOPE\n",
      "Description:\n",
      "Whole genome single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) enables characterization of copy number profiles at the cellular level. This circumvents the averaging effects associated with bulk-tissue sequencing and has increased resolution yet decreased ambiguity in deconvolving cancer subclones and elucidating cancer evolutionary history. ScDNA-seq data is, however, sparse, noisy, and highly variable even within a homogeneous cell population, due to the biases and artifacts that are introduced during the library preparation and sequencing procedure. Here, we propose SCOPE, a normalization and copy number estimation method for scDNA-seq data. The distinguishing features of SCOPE include: (i) utilization of cell-specific Gini coefficients for quality controls and for identification of normal/diploid cells, which are further used as negative control samples in a Poisson latent factor model for normalization; (ii) modeling of GC content bias using an expectation-maximization algorithm embedded in the Poisson generalized linear models, which accounts for the different copy number states along the genome; (iii) a cross-sample iterative segmentation procedure to identify breakpoints that are shared across cells from the same genetic background.\n",

      "Genome segmentation with hidden Markov models has become a useful tool to annotate genomic elements, such as promoters and enhancers. STAN (genomic STate ANnotation) implements (bidirectional) hidden Markov models (HMMs) using a variety of different probability distributions, which can model a wide range of current genomic data (e.g. continuous, discrete, binary). STAN de novo learns and annotates the genome into a given number of 'genomic states'. The 'genomic states' may for instance reflect distinct genome-associated protein complexes (e.g. 'transcription states') or describe recurring patterns of chromatin features (referred to as 'chromatin states'). Unlike other tools, STAN also allows for the integration of strand-specific (e.g. RNA) and non-strand-specific data (e.g. ChIP).\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "clustComp is a package that implements several techniques for the comparison and visualisation of relationships between different clustering results, either flat versus flat or hierarchical versus flat. These relationships among clusters are displayed using a weighted bi-graph, in which the nodes represent the clusters and the edges connect pairs of nodes with non-empty intersection; the weight of each edge is the number of elements in that intersection and is displayed through the edge thickness. The best layout of the bi-graph is provided by the barycentre algorithm, which minimises the weighted number of crossings. In the case of comparing a hierarchical and a non-hierarchical clustering, the dendrogram is pruned at different heights, selected by exploring the tree by depth-first search, starting at the root. Branches are decided to be split according to the value of a scoring function, that can be based either on the aesthetics of the bi-graph or on the mutual information between the hierarchical and the flat clusterings. A mapping between groups of clusters from each side is constructed with a greedy algorithm, and can be additionally visualised.\n",

To improve the detection of low abundant signals, cosmiq generates master maps of the mZ/RT space from all acquired runs before a peak detection algorithm is applied. The result is a more robust identification and quantification of low-intensity MS signals compared to conventional approaches where peak picking is performed in each LCMS/GCMS file separately. The cosmiq package builds on the xcmsSet object structure and can be therefore integrated well with the package xcms as an alternative preprocessing step.\n",

Vectors are preferred that target sensitive regions less frequently, motivating the search for localized clusters of insertions and comparison of the clusters formed by integration of different vectors. Scan statistics allow the discovery of spatial differences in clustering and calculation of False Discovery Rates (FDRs) providing statistical methods for comparing retroviral vectors. A scan statistic for comparing two vectors using multiple window widths to detect clustering differentials and compute FDRs is implemented here.\n",

      "geneXtendeR optimizes the functional annotation of ChIP-seq peaks by exploring relative differences in annotating ChIP-seq peak sets to variable-length gene bodies. In contrast to prior techniques, geneXtendeR considers peak annotations beyond just the closest gene, allowing users to see peak summary statistics for the first-closest gene, second-closest gene, ..., n-closest gene whilst ranking the output according to biologically relevant events and iteratively comparing the fidelity of peak-to-gene overlap across a user-defined range of upstream and downstream extensions on the original boundaries of each gene's coordinates. Since different ChIP-seq peak callers produce different differentially enriched peaks with a large variance in peak length distribution and total peak count, annotating peak lists with their nearest genes can often be a noisy process. As such, the goal of geneXtendeR is to robustly link differentially enriched peaks with their respective genes, thereby aiding experimental follow-up and validation in designing primers for a set of prospective gene candidates during qPCR.\n",

      "'motifcounter' provides motif matching, motif counting and motif enrichment functionality based on position frequency matrices. The main features of the packages include the utilization of higher-order background models and accounting for self-overlapping motif matches when determining motif enrichment. The background model allows to capture dinucleotide (or higher-order nucleotide) composition adequately which may reduced model biases and misleading results compared to using simple GC background models. When conducting a motif enrichment analysis based on the motif match count, the package relies on a compound Poisson distribution or alternatively a combinatorial model. These distribution account for self-overlapping motif structures as exemplified by repeat-like or palindromic motifs, and allow to determine the p-value and fold-enrichment for a set of observed motif matches.\n",

We have derived three parametric approximations to the permutation distributions of two gene set enrichment test statistics. We are able to reduce the computational burden and granularity issues of permutation testing with our method, which is implemented in this package. npGSEA calculates gene set enrichment statistics and p-values without the computational cost of permutations. It is applicable in settings where one or many gene sets are of interest. There are also built-in plotting functions to help users visualize results.\n",

Given such an object, a set of alternative parameters/methods, and benchmark datasets, the `runPipeline` function then proceeds through all combinations arguments, avoiding recomputing the same step twice and compiling evaluations on the fly to avoid storing potentially large intermediate data.\n",

STdeconvolve builds on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative statistical model commonly used in natural language processing for discovering latent topics in collections of documents. In the context of natural language processing, given a count matrix of words in documents, LDA infers the distribution of words for each topic and the distribution of topics in each document. In the context of ST data, given a count matrix of gene expression in multi-cellular ST pixels, STdeconvolve applies LDA to infer the putative transcriptional profile for each cell-type and the proportional representation of each cell-type in each multi-cellular ST pixel.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Functional enrichment analysis methods such as gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) have been widely used for analyzing gene expression data. GSEA is a powerful method to infer results of gene expression data at a level of gene sets by calculating enrichment scores for predefined sets of genes. GSEA depends on the availability and accuracy of gene sets. There are overlaps between terms of gene sets or categories because multiple terms may exist for a single biological process, and it can thus lead to redundancy within enriched terms. In other words, the sets of related terms are overlapping. Using deep learning, this pakage is aimed to predict enrichment scores for unique tokens or words from text in names of gene sets to resolve this overlapping set issue. Furthermore, we can coin a new term by combining tokens and find its enrichment score by predicting such a combined tokens.\n",

PAR-CLIP-induced transitions are first discriminated from sequencing errors, SNPs and additional non-experimental sources by a non- parametric mixture model. The protein binding sites (clusters) are then resolved at high resolution and cluster statistics are estimated using a rigorous Bayesian framework. Post-processing of the results, data export for UCSC genome browser visualization and motif search analysis are provided. In addition, the package allows to integrate RNA-Seq data to estimate the False Discovery Rate of cluster detection. Key functions support parallel multicore computing. Note: while wavClusteR was designed for PAR-CLIP data analysis, it can be applied to the analysis of other NGS data obtained from experimental procedures that induce nucleotide substitutions (e.g. BisSeq).\n",

      "This package has been developed to evaluate cellular engineering processes for direct differentiation of stem cells or conversion (transdifferentiation) of somatic cells to primary cells based on high throughput gene expression data screened either by DNA microarray or RNA sequencing. The package takes gene expression profiles as inputs from three types of samples: (i) somatic or stem cells to be (trans)differentiated (input of the engineering process), (ii) induced cells to be evaluated (output of the engineering process) and (iii) target primary cells (reference for the output). The package performs differential gene expression analysis for each pair-wise sample comparison to identify and evaluate the transcriptional differences among the 3 types of samples (input, output, reference). The ideal goal is to have induced and primary reference cell showing overlapping profiles, both very different from the original cells.\n",

It guides the steps from segmentation to calculation of features, filtering out particles not of interest, providing also a set of utilities to help checking the quality of the performed operations (e.g. how good the segmentation was). It allows investigating the issue of tracking flowing cells such as in blood vessels, to categorize the particles in flowing, rolling and adherent. This classification is applied in the study of phenomena such as hemostasis and study of thrombosis development. Moreover, flowcatchR presents an integrated workflow solution, based on the integration with a Shiny App and Jupyter notebooks, which is delivered alongside the package, and can enable fully reproducible bioimage analysis in the R environment.\n",

Selecting informative features affects the subsequent classification and regression analyses by improving their overall performances. Several methods have been proposed to perform feature selection: most of them relies on univariate statistics, correlation, entropy measurements or the usage of backward/forward regressions. Herein, we propose an efficient, robust and fast method that adopts stochastic optimization approaches for high-dimensional. GARS is an innovative implementation of a genetic algorithm that selects robust features in high-dimensional and challenging datasets.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Single-cell RNA-Seq data is useful in discovering cell heterogeneity and signature genes in specific cell populations in cancer and other complex diseases. Specifically, the investigation of functional gene modules (FGM) can help to understand gene interactive networks and complex biological processes. QUBIC2 is recognized as one of the most efficient and effective tools for FGM identification from scRNA-Seq data. However, its availability is limited to a C implementation, and its applicative power is affected by only a few downstream analyses functionalities. We developed an R package named IRIS-FGM (integrative scRNA-Seq interpretation system for functional gene module analysis) to support the investigation of FGMs and cell clustering using scRNA-Seq data. Empowered by QUBIC2, IRIS-FGM can identify co-expressed and co-regulated FGMs, predict types/clusters, identify differentially expressed genes, and perform functional enrichment analysis. It is noteworthy that IRIS-FGM also applies Seurat objects that can be easily used in the Seurat vignettes.\n",

Statistical tests can be selected and added to the graphs. Analysis of flow cytometry data is especially integrated with plotGrouper. Count data can be transformed to return the absolute number of cells in a sample (this feature requires inclusion of the number of beads per sample and information about any dilution performed).\n",

The RLasso-Cox model integrates gene interaction information into the Lasso-Cox model for accurate survival prediction and survival biomarker discovery. It is based on the hypothesis that topologically important genes in the gene interaction network tend to have stable expression changes. The RLasso-Cox model uses random walk to evaluate the topological weight of genes, and then highlights topologically important genes to improve the generalization ability of the Lasso-Cox model. The RLasso-Cox model has the advantage of identifying small gene sets with high prognostic performance on independent datasets, which may play an important role in identifying robust survival biomarkers for various cancer types.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Seq2pathway is a novel tool for functional gene-set (or termed as pathway) analysis of next-generation sequencing data, consisting of \"seq2gene\" and \"gene2path\" components. The seq2gene links sequence-level measurements of genomic regions (including SNPs or point mutation coordinates) to gene-level scores, and the gene2pathway summarizes gene scores to pathway-scores for each sample. The seq2gene has the feasibility to assign both coding and non-exon regions to a broader range of neighboring genes than only the nearest one, thus facilitating the study of functional non-coding regions. The gene2pathway takes into account the quantity of significance for gene members within a pathway compared those outside a pathway. The output of seq2pathway is a general structure of quantitative pathway-level scores, thus allowing one to functional interpret such datasets as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, GWAS, and derived from other next generational sequencing experiments.\n",

Phylogenetic formats can vary from dendrogram-like phylogenies with leaf nodes to evolutionary model-derived phylogenies with observed or latent internal nodes. The CellScape phylogeny is flexibly input as a table of source-target edges to support arbitrary representations, where each node may or may not have associated genomic data. The output of CellScape is an interactive interface displaying a single cell phylogeny and a cell-by-locus genomic heatmap representing the mutation status in each cell for each locus.\n",

Missing information needs to be presented as `NA` values and not as zero values, because CONSTANd is able to ignore missing values when calculating the mean. Using CONSTANd normalization allows for the direct comparison of values between samples within the same and even across different CONSTANd-normalized data matrices.\n",

In this way, DECD describes the DEGs of complex disease in a novel syntax, e.g. a gene list composed of 200 genes are differentially expressed in 30% percent of studied complex disease. Applying the DECD analysis results, users are possible to find the patients affected by the same mechanism based on the shared signatures.\n",

The approach produces a matrix of corrected expression for which the dependency between sequencing depth and the full distribution of normalized expression; many existing methods aim to remove only the dependency between sequencing depth and the mean of the normalized expression. This is particuarly useful in the context of highly sparse datasets such as those produced by 10X genomics and other uninque molecular identifier (UMI) based microfluidics protocols for which the depth-dependent proportion of zeros in the raw expression data can otherwise present a challenge.\n",

A ProbeLevelSet directly extends the expressionSet, but includes additional information about the sequence of each probe and the probe set it is derived from. The package includes a number of functions used for plotting these probe level data as a function of location along sequences of mRNA-strands. This can be used for analysis of variable splicing, and is especially well suited for use with exon-array data.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has successfully been used to identify single-nucleotide variants (SNV), small insertions and deletions (INDELs) and, more recently, small copy number variants (CNVs). However, due to utilization of short reads, it is not well suited for identification of structural variants (SV). Optical mapping (OM) from Bionano Genomics, utilizes long fluorescently labeled megabase size DNA molecules for de novo genome assembly and identification of SVs with a much higher sensitivity than WGS. Nevertheless, currently available SV annotation tools have limited number of functions. NanotatoR is an R package written to provide a set of annotations for SVs identified by OM. It uses Database of Genomic Variants (DGV), Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans Using Ensembl Resources (DECIPHER) as well as a subset (154 samples) of 1000 Genome Project to calculate the population frequencies of the SVs (an optional internal cohort SV frequency calculation is also available). NanotatoR creates a primary gene list (PG) from NCBI databases based on probandâs phenotype specific keywords and compares the list to the set of genes overlapping/near SVs. The output is given in an Excel file format, which is subdivided into multiple sheets based on SV type (e.g., INDELs, Inversions, Translocations). Users then have a choice to filter SVs using the provided annotations for de novo (if parental samples are available) or inherited rare variants.\n",

Here we present the proFIA package, which implements a new methodology to pre-process FIA-HRMS raw data (netCDF, mzData, mzXML, and mzML) including noise modelling and injection peak reconstruction, and generate the peak table. The workflow includes noise modelling, band detection and filtering then signal matching and missing value imputation. The peak table can then be exported as a .tsv file for further analysis. Visualisations to assess the quality of the data and of the signal made are easely produced.\n",

      "RegulonDB has collected, harmonized and centralized data from hundreds of experiments for nearly two decades and is considered a point of reference for transcriptional regulation in Escherichia coli K12. Here, we present the regutools R package to facilitate programmatic access to RegulonDB data in computational biology. regutools provides researchers with the possibility of writing reproducible workflows with automated queries to RegulonDB. The regutools package serves as a bridge between RegulonDB data and the Bioconductor ecosystem by reusing the data structures and statistical methods powered by other Bioconductor packages. We demonstrate the integration of regutools with Bioconductor by analyzing transcription factor DNA binding sites and transcriptional regulatory networks from RegulonDB. We anticipate that regutools will serve as a useful building block in our progress to further our understanding of gene regulatory networks.\n",

      "sRACIPE implements a randomization-based method for gene circuit modeling. It allows us to study the effect of both the gene expression noise and the parametric variation on any gene regulatory circuit (GRC) using only its topology, and simulates an ensemble of models with random kinetic parameters at multiple noise levels. Statistical analysis of the generated gene expressions reveals the basin of attraction and stability of various phenotypic states and their changes associated with intrinsic and extrinsic noises. sRACIPE provides a holistic picture to evaluate the effects of both the stochastic nature of cellular processes and the parametric variation.\n",

      "The twoddpcr package takes Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) droplet amplitude data from Bio-Rad's QuantaSoft and can classify the droplets. A summary of the positive/negative droplet counts can be generated, which can then be used to estimate the number of molecules using the Poisson distribution. This is the first open source package that facilitates the automatic classification of general two channel ddPCR data. Previous work includes 'definetherain' (Jones et al., 2014) and 'ddpcRquant' (Trypsteen et al., 2015) which both handle one channel ddPCR experiments only. The 'ddpcr' package available on CRAN (Attali et al., 2016) supports automatic gating of a specific class of two channel ddPCR experiments only.\n",

The packge fits a robust Bayesian hierarchical model for testing for differential expression. Outliers are modeled explicitly using a $t$-distribution. The model includes an exchangeable prior for the variances which allow different variances for the genes but still shrink extreme empirical variances. Our model can be used for testing for differentially expressed genes among multiple samples, and can distinguish between the different possible patterns of differential expression when there are three or more samples. Parameter estimation is carried out using a novel version of Markov Chain Monte Carlo that is appropriate when the model puts mass on subspaces of the full parameter space.\n",

BUS is capable of (a) correcting batch effects explicitly, (b) grouping samples that share similar characteristics into subtypes, (c) identifying features that distinguish subtypes, and (d) enjoying a linear-order computation complexity.\n",

      "Name: DMRforPairs\n",
      "Description:\n",
      "DMRforPairs (formerly DMR2+) allows researchers to compare n>=2 unique samples with regard to their methylation profile. The (pairwise) comparison of n unique single samples distinguishes DMRforPairs from other existing pipelines as these often compare groups of samples in either single CpG locus or region based analysis. DMRforPairs defines regions of interest as genomic ranges with sufficient probes located in close proximity to each other. Probes in one region are optionally annotated to the same functional class(es). Differential methylation is evaluated by comparing the methylation values within each region between individual samples and (if the difference is sufficiently large), testing this difference formally for statistical significance.\n",

      "doseR package is a next generation sequencing package for sex chromosome dosage compensation which can be applied broadly to detect shifts in gene expression among an arbitrary number of pre-defined groups of loci. doseR is a differential gene expression package for count data, that detects directional shifts in expression for multiple, specific subsets of genes, broad utility in systems biology research. doseR has been prepared to manage the nature of the data and the desired set of inferences. doseR uses S4 classes to store count data from sequencing experiment. It contains functions to normalize and filter count data, as well as to plot and calculate statistics of count data. It contains a framework for linear modeling of count data. The package has been tested using real and simulated data.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "In epigenome-wide association studies, the measured signals for each sample are a mixture of methylation profiles from different cell types. The current approaches to the association detection only claim whether a cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site is associated with the phenotype or not, but they cannot determine the cell type in which the risk-CpG site is affected by the phenotype. We propose a solid statistical method, HIgh REsolution (HIRE), which not only substantially improves the power of association detection at the aggregated level as compared to the existing methods but also enables the detection of risk-CpG sites for individual cell types. The \"HIREewas\" R package is to implement HIRE model in R.\n",

      "A two-step approach to imputing missing data in metabolomics. Step 1 uses a random forest classifier to classify missing values as either Missing Completely at Random/Missing At Random (MCAR/MAR) or Missing Not At Random (MNAR). MCAR/MAR are combined because it is often difficult to distinguish these two missing types in metabolomics data. Step 2 imputes the missing values based on the classified missing mechanisms, using the appropriate imputation algorithms. Imputation algorithms tested and available for MCAR/MAR include Bayesian Principal Component Analysis (BPCA), Multiple Imputation No-Skip K-Nearest Neighbors (Multi_nsKNN), and Random Forest. Imputation algorithms tested and available for MNAR include nsKNN and a single imputation approach for imputation of metabolites where left-censoring is present.\n",

Only a minimal user parameter setting is required to perform both singular and gene set enrichment analyses in an integrative manner by means of the best available methods, i.e. dEnricher and mGSZ respectively. The greatest strengths of this big omics data tool are the availability of several functions to explore, analyze and visualize its results in order to facilitate the data mining task over huge information sources. MIGSA package also provides several functions that allow to easily load the most updated gene sets from several repositories.\n",

This is done by computing similarity networks of biclusters and filtering for overlaps using a custom error model. After that, the louvain modularity it used to extract bicluster communities from the similarity network, which can then be converted to ensemble biclusters. Additionally, MoSBi includes several network visualization methods to give an intuitive and scalable overview of the results. MoSBi comes with several biclustering algorithms, but can be easily extended to new biclustering algorithms.\n",

      "Nucleolus is an important structure inside the nucleus in eukaryotic cells. It is the site for transcribing rDNA into rRNA and for assembling ribosomes, aka ribosome biogenesis. In addition, nucleoli are dynamic hubs through which numerous proteins shuttle and contact specific non-rDNA genomic loci. Deep sequencing analyses of DNA associated with isolated nucleoli (NAD- seq) have shown that specific loci, termed nucleolus- associated domains (NADs) form frequent three- dimensional associations with nucleoli. NAD-seq has been used to study the biological functions of NAD and the dynamics of NAD distribution during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Here, we developed a Bioconductor package NADfinder for bioinformatic analysis of the NAD-seq data, including baseline correction, smoothing, normalization, peak calling, and annotation.\n",

It annotates, filters and presents genomic variants (especially rare ones) in a global, per chromosome way. For discovered rare variants CRISPR guide RNAs are designed, so the user can plan further functional studies. Large structural variants, including copy number variants are also supported. Package accepts variants directly from variant caller - for example GATK or Speedseq. Output of package are lists of variants together with adequate visualization. Visualization of variants is performed in two ways - standard that outputs png figures and interactive that uses JavaScript d3 package. Interactive visualization allows to analyze trio/family data, for example in search for causative variants in rare Mendelian diseases, in point-and-click interface. The package includes homozygous region caller and allows to analyse whole human genomes in less than 30 minutes on a desktop computer. RareVariantVis disclosed novel causes of several rare monogenic disorders, including one with non-coding causative variant - keratolythic winter erythema.\n",

      "Chromatin looping is an essential feature of eukaryotic genomes and can bring regulatory sequences, such as enhancers or transcription factor binding sites, in the close physical proximity of regulated target genes. Here, we provide sevenC, an R package that uses protein binding signals from ChIP-seq and sequence motif information to predict chromatin looping events. Cross-linking of proteins that bind close to loop anchors result in ChIP-seq signals at both anchor loci. These signals are used at CTCF motif pairs together with their distance and orientation to each other to predict whether they interact or not. The resulting chromatin loops might be used to associate enhancers or transcription factor binding sites (e.g., ChIP-seq peaks) to regulated target genes.\n",

This package allows processing of UMI-4C data, starting from FastQ files provided by the sequencing facility. It provides two statistical methods for detecting differential contacts and includes a visualization function to plot integrated information from a UMI-4C assay.\n",

      "VeloViz uses each cellâs current observed and predicted future transcriptional states inferred from RNA velocity analysis to build a nearest neighbor graph between cells in the population. Edges are then pruned based on a cosine correlation threshold and/or a distance threshold and the resulting graph is visualized using a force-directed graph layout algorithm. VeloViz can help ensure that relationships between cell states are reflected in the 2D embedding, allowing for more reliable representation of underlying cellular trajectories.\n",

A basic and standardized version of the main differential abundance analysis methods is supplied but the user can also add his method to the benchmark. The analyses focus on 4 main aspects: i) the goodness of fit of each method's distributional assumptions on the observed count data, ii) the ability to control the false discovery rate, iii) the within and between method concordances, iv) the truthfulness of the findings if any apriori knowledge is given. Several graphical functions are available for result visualization.\n",

The term class clusters here refers to, clusters of points representing known classes in the data. This is particularly useful to determine if a subset of the variables, e.g. genes in a specific pathway, alone can separate samples into these established classes.

Cluster separations are then scored and the probability of the seen separation being due to chance is evaluated using a permutation method.\n",

Additionally, it also computes the feature-wise shrunk effect sizes and their corresponding shrunken effect size. Further, it calculates the percent of differentially expressed features and plots user-friendly heatmap of the top differentially expressed features on the rows and samples on the columns.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "The identification of novel compound-protein interaction (CPI) is important in drug discovery. Revealing unknown compound-protein interactions is useful to design a new drug for a target protein by screening candidate compounds. The accurate CPI prediction assists in effective drug discovery process. To identify potential CPI effectively, prediction methods based on machine learning and deep learning have been developed. Data for sequences are provided as discrete symbolic data. In the data, compounds are represented as SMILES (simplified molecular-input line-entry system) strings and proteins are sequences in which the characters are amino acids. The outcome is defined as a variable that indicates how strong two molecules interact with each other or whether there is an interaction between them. In this package, a deep-learning based model that takes only sequence information of both compounds and proteins as input and the outcome as output is used to predict CPI. The model is implemented by using compound and protein encoders with useful features. The CPI model also supports other modeling tasks, including protein-protein interaction (PPI), chemical-chemical interaction (CCI), or single compounds and proteins. Although the model is designed for proteins, DNA and RNA can be used if they are represented as sequences.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "A pipeline for identifying differentially methylated CpG sites using Hidden Markov Model in bisulfite sequencing data. DNA methylation studies have enabled researchers to understand methylation patterns and their regulatory roles in biological processes and disease. However, only a limited number of statistical approaches have been developed to provide formal quantitative analysis. Specifically, a few available methods do identify differentially methylated CpG (DMC) sites or regions (DMR), but they suffer from limitations that arise mostly due to challenges inherent in bisulfite sequencing data. These challenges include: (1) that read-depths vary considerably among genomic positions and are often low; (2) both methylation and autocorrelation patterns change as regions change; and (3) CpG sites are distributed unevenly. Furthermore, there are several methodological limitations: almost none of these tools is capable of comparing multiple groups and/or working with missing values, and only a few allow continuous or multiple covariates. The last of these is of great interest among researchers, as the goal is often to find which regions of the genome are associated with several exposures and traits. To tackle these issues, we have developed an efficient DMC identification method based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) called âDMCHMMâ which is a three-step approach (model selection, prediction, testing) aiming to address the aforementioned drawbacks.\n",

      "A package to identify very short IBD segments in large sequencing data by FABIA biclustering. Two haplotypes are identical by descent (IBD) if they share a segment that both inherited from a common ancestor. Current IBD methods reliably detect long IBD segments because many minor alleles in the segment are concordant between the two haplotypes. However, many cohort studies contain unrelated individuals which share only short IBD segments. This package provides software to identify short IBD segments in sequencing data. Knowledge of short IBD segments are relevant for phasing of genotyping data, association studies, and for population genetics, where they shed light on the evolutionary history of humans. The package supports VCF formats, is based on sparse matrix operations, and provides visualization of haplotype clusters in different formats.\n",

      "Name: LRcell\n",
      "Description:\n",
      "The goal of LRcell is to identify specific sub-cell types that drives the changes observed in a bulk RNA-seq differential gene expression experiment. To achieve this, LRcell utilizes sets of cell marker genes acquired from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) as indicators for various cell types in the tissue of interest. Next, for each cell type, using its marker genes as indicators, we apply Logistic Regression on the complete set of genes with differential expression p-values to calculate a cell-type significance p-value. Finally, these p-values are compared to predict which one(s) are likely to be responsible for the differential gene expression pattern observed in the bulk RNA-seq experiments. LRcell is inspired by the LRpath[@sartor2009lrpath] algorithm developed by Sartor et al., originally designed for pathway/gene set enrichment analysis. LRcell contains three major components: LRcell analysis, plot generation and marker gene selection. All modules in this package are written in R. This package also provides marker genes in the Prefrontal Cortex (pFC) human brain region, human PBMC and nine mouse brain regions (Frontal Cortex, Cerebellum, Globus Pallidus, Hippocampus, Entopeduncular, Posterior Cortex, Striatum, Substantia Nigra and Thalamus).\n",

It efficiently implements the machine learning model based on vectorization of nucleotide sequences and the random forest classification algorithm. The ORFhunteR package consists of a set of functions written in the R language in conjunction with C++. The efficiency of the package was confirmed by the examples of the analysis of RNA molecules from the NCBI RefSeq and Ensembl databases. The package can be used in basic and applied biomedical research related to the study of the transcriptome of normal as well as altered (for example, cancer) human cells.\n",

      "The rmspc package runs MSPC (Multiple Sample Peak Calling) software using R. The analysis of ChIP-seq samples outputs a number of enriched regions (commonly known as \"peaks\"), each indicating a protein-DNA interaction or a specific chromatin modification. When replicate samples are analyzed, overlapping peaks are expected. This repeated evidence can therefore be used to locally lower the minimum significance required to accept a peak. MSPC uses combined evidence from replicated experiments to evaluate peak calling output, rescuing peaks, and reduce false positives. It takes any number of replicates as input and improves sensitivity and specificity of peak calling on each, and identifies consensus regions between the input samples.\n",

It is based on the identification of sample-specific gene signatures composed of the most up- and down-regulated genes for that sample. Starting from gene expression data, functions in this package identify sample-specific gene signatures and use them to build a graph of samples. In this graph samples are joined by edges if they have a similar expression profile, according to a pre-computed similarity matrix. The similarity between the expression profiles of two samples is computed using a method similar to GSEA. The graph of samples can then be used to perform community clustering or to perform supervised classification of samples in a testing set.\n",

      "The package is to provide a model based Bayesian method to characterize and simulate microbiome data. sparseDOSSA's model captures the marginal distribution of each microbial feature as a truncated, zero-inflated log-normal distribution, with parameters distributed as a parent log-normal distribution. The model can be effectively fit to reference microbial datasets in order to parameterize their microbes and communities, or to simulate synthetic datasets of similar population structure. Most importantly, it allows users to include both known feature-feature and feature-metadata correlation structures and thus provides a gold standard to enable benchmarking of statistical methods for metagenomic data analysis.\n",

      "The package calculates the indexes for selective stength in codon usage in bacteria species.

The method take into account of background mutation rate, and focus only on four pairs of codons with universal translational advantages in all bacterial species. Thus the sscu index is comparable among different species. (2) The package can detect the strength of translational accuracy selection by Akashi's test. The test tabulating all codons into four categories with the feature as conserved/variable amino acids and optimal/non-optimal codons. (3) Optimal codon lists (selected codons) can be calculated by either op_highly function (by using the highly expressed genes compared with all genes to identify optimal codons), or op_corre_CodonW/op_corre_NCprime function (by correlative method developed by Hershberg & Petrov). Users will have a list of optimal codons for further analysis, such as input to the Akashi's test. (4) The detailed codon usage information, such as RSCU value, number of optimal codons in the highly/all gene set, as well as the genomic gc3 value, can be calculate by the optimal_codon_statistics and genomic_gc3 function. (5) Furthermore, we added one test function low_frequency_op in the package. The function try to find the low frequency optimal codons, among all the optimal codons identified by the op_highly function.\n",

      "Name: TargetDecoy\n",
      "Description:\n",
      "A first step in the data analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) based proteomics data is to identify peptides and proteins. With this respect the huge number of experimental mass spectra typically have to be assigned to theoretical peptides derived from a sequence database. Search engines are used for this purpose. These tools compare each of the observed spectra to all candidate theoretical spectra derived from the sequence data base and calculate a score for each comparison. The observed spectrum is then assigned to the theoretical peptide with the best score, which is also referred to as the peptide to spectrum match (PSM). It is of course crucial for the downstream analysis to evaluate the quality of these matches. Therefore False Discovery Rate (FDR) control is used to return a reliable list PSMs. The FDR, however, requires a good characterisation of the score distribution of PSMs that are matched to the wrong peptide (bad target hits). In proteomics, the target decoy approach (TDA) is typically used for this purpose. The TDA method matches the spectra to a database of real (targets) and nonsense peptides (decoys). A popular approach to generate these decoys is to reverse the target database. Hence, all the PSMs that match to a decoy are known to be bad hits and the distribution of their scores are used to estimate the distribution of the bad scoring target PSMs. A crucial assumption of the TDA is that the decoy PSM hits have similar properties as bad target hits so that the decoy PSM scores are a good simulation of the target PSM scores. Users, however, typically do not evaluate these assumptions. To this end we developed TargetDecoy to generate diagnostic plots to evaluate the quality of the target decoy method.\n",

More precise information and interesting tests can be done via ii), but it is harder to use this information as meta-data as it requires more effort to interpret it and it is of course run-time information.

      "APL is a package developed for computation of Association Plots (AP), a method for visualization and analysis of single cell transcriptomics data. The main focus of APL is the identification of genes characteristic for individual clusters of cells from input data. The package performs correspondence analysis (CA) and allows to identify cluster-specific genes using Association Plots. Additionally, APL computes the cluster-specificity scores for all genes which allows to rank the genes by their specificity for a selected cell cluster of interest.\n",

It is robust and flexible with respect to the true underlying models and inclusion of any covariates, and the missing values are imputed using spatial correlation between positions and samples. A Bayesian approach is adopted for estimation and inference in the proposed method.\n",

      "We presented the Genotype-imputed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GIGSEA), a novel method that uses GWAS-and-eQTL-imputed trait-associated differential gene expression to interrogate gene set enrichment for the trait-associated SNPs. By incorporating eQTL from large gene expression studies, e.g. GTEx, GIGSEA appropriately addresses such challenges for SNP enrichment as gene size, gene boundary, SNP distal regulation, and multiple-marker regulation. The weighted linear regression model, taking as weights both imputation accuracy and model completeness, was used to perform the enrichment test, properly adjusting the bias due to redundancy in different gene sets. The permutation test, furthermore, is used to evaluate the significance of enrichment, whose efficiency can be largely elevated by expressing the computational intensive part in terms of large matrix operation. We have shown the appropriate type I error rates for GIGSEA (<5%), and the preliminary results also demonstrate its good performance to uncover the real signal.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Genetic variants associated with diseases often affect non-coding regions, thus likely having a regulatory role. To understand the effects of genetic variants in these regulatory regions, identifying genes that are modulated by specific regulatory elements (REs) is crucial. The effect of gene regulatory elements, such as enhancers, is often cell-type specific, likely because the combinations of transcription factors (TFs) that are regulating a given enhancer have celltype specific activity. This TF activity can be quantified with existing tools such as diffTF and captures differences in binding of a TF in open chromatin regions. Collectively, this forms a gene regulatory network (GRN) with cell-type and data-specific TF-RE and RE-gene links. Here, we reconstruct such a GRN using bulk RNAseq and open chromatin (e.g., using ATACseq or ChIPseq for open chromatin marks) and optionally TF activity data. Our network contains different types of links, connecting TFs to regulatory elements, the latter of which is connected to genes in the vicinity or within the same chromatin domain (TAD). We use a statistical framework to assign empirical FDRs and weights to all links using a permutation-based approach.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Reconstructing gene regulatory networks and transcription factor activity is crucial to understand biological processes and holds potential for developing personalized treatment. Yet, it is still an open problem as state-of-art algorithm are often not able to handle large amounts of data. Furthermore, many of the present methods predict numerous false positives and are unable to integrate other sources of information such as previously known interactions. Here we introduce KBoost, an algorithm that uses kernel PCA regression, boosting and Bayesian model averaging for fast and accurate reconstruction of gene regulatory networks. KBoost can also use a prior network built on previously known transcription factor targets. We have benchmarked KBoost using three different datasets against other high performing algorithms. The results show that our method compares favourably to other methods across datasets.\n",

Note: This package was designed to demonstrate the use of chemical maps in prediction. As the parental package NuPoP now provide chemical-map-based prediction, users are strongly encouraged to use it for dHMM-based prediction.\n",

      "Determining the sample size for adequate power to detect statistical significance is a crucial step at the design stage for high-throughput experiments. Even though a number of methods and tools are available for sample size calculation for microarray and RNA-seq in the context of differential expression (DE), this topic in the field of single-cell RNA sequencing is understudied. Moreover, the unique data characteristics present in scRNA-seq such as sparsity and heterogeneity increase the challenge. We propose POWSC, a simulation-based method, to provide power evaluation and sample size recommendation for single-cell RNA sequencing DE analysis. POWSC consists of a data simulator that creates realistic expression data, and a power assessor that provides a comprehensive evaluation and visualization of the power and sample size relationship.\n",

      "Publicly available RNA-seq data is routinely used for retrospective analysis to elucidate new biology. Novel transcript discovery enabled by large collections of RNA-seq datasets has emerged as one of such analysis. To increase the power of transcript discovery from large collections of RNA-seq datasets, we developed a new R package named Pooling RNA-seq and Assembling Models (PRAM), which builds transcript models in intergenic regions from pooled RNA-seq datasets. This package includes functions for defining intergenic regions, extracting and pooling related RNA-seq alignments, predicting, selected, and evaluating transcript models.\n",

RCSL uses Spearmanâs rank correlations of a cellâs expression vector with those of other cells to measure its global similar-ity, and adaptively learns neighbour representation of a cell as its local similarity. The overall similar-ity of a cell to other cells is a linear combination of its global similarity and local similarity.\n",

Several strategies have been previously used, but all of them provide biased results. With Rmmquant, if a read maps at different positions, the tool detects that the corresponding genes are duplicated; it merges the genes and creates a merged gene. The counts of ambiguous reads is then based on the input genes and the merged genes. Rmmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools findOverlaps and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way.\n",

      "Name: SNPhood\n",
      "Description:\n",
      "To date, thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found to be associated with complex traits and diseases. However, the vast majority of these disease-associated SNPs lie in the non-coding part of the genome, and are likely to affect regulatory elements, such as enhancers and promoters, rather than function of a protein. Thus, to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic traits and diseases, it becomes increasingly important to study the effect of a SNP on nearby molecular traits such as chromatin environment or transcription factor (TF) binding. Towards this aim, we developed SNPhood, a user-friendly *Bioconductor* R package to investigate and visualize the local neighborhood of a set of SNPs of interest for NGS data such as chromatin marks or transcription factor binding sites from ChIP-Seq or RNA- Seq experiments. SNPhood comprises a set of easy-to-use functions to extract, normalize and summarize reads for a genomic region, perform various data quality checks, normalize read counts using additional input files, and to cluster and visualize the regions according to the binding pattern. The regions around each SNP can be binned in a user-defined fashion to allow for analysis of very broad patterns as well as a detailed investigation of specific binding shapes. Furthermore, SNPhood supports the integration with genotype information to investigate and visualize genotype-specific binding patterns. Finally, SNPhood can be employed for determining, investigating, and visualizing allele-specific binding patterns around the SNPs of interest.\n",

      "ExCluster flattens Ensembl and GENCODE GTF files into GFF files, which are used to count reads per non-overlapping exon bin from BAM files. This read counting is done using the function featureCounts from the package Rsubread. Library sizes are normalized across all biological replicates, and ExCluster then compares two different conditions to detect signifcantly differentially spliced genes. This process requires at least two independent biological repliates per condition, and ExCluster accepts only exactly two conditions at a time. ExCluster ultimately produces false discovery rates (FDRs) per gene, which are used to detect significance. Exon log2 fold change (log2FC) means and variances may be plotted for each significantly differentially spliced gene, which helps scientists develop hypothesis and target differential splicing events for RT-qPCR validation in the wet lab.\n",

There are four inputs to MapScape: (i) the clonal phylogeny, (ii) clonal prevalences, (iii) an image reference, which may be a medical image or drawing and (iv) pixel locations for each sample on the referenced image. Optionally, MapScape can accept a data table of mutations for each clone and their variant allele frequencies in each sample. The output of MapScape consists of a cropped anatomical image surrounded by two representations of each tumour sample. The first, a cellular aggregate, visually displays the prevalence of each clone. The second shows a skeleton of the clonal phylogeny while highlighting only those clones present in the sample. Together, these representations enable the analyst to visualize the distribution of clones throughout anatomic space.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has a relatively poor prognosis and is one of the most lethal cancers. Molecular classification of gene expression profiles holds the potential to identify meaningful subtypes which can inform therapeutic strategy in the clinical setting. The Pancreatic Cancer Adenocarcinoma Tool-Kit (PDATK) provides an S4 class-based interface for performing unsupervised subtype discovery, cross-cohort meta-clustering, gene-expression-based classification, and subsequent survival analysis to identify prognostically useful subtypes in pancreatic cancer and beyond. Two novel methods, Consensus Subtypes in Pancreatic Cancer (CSPC) and Pancreatic Cancer Overall Survival Predictor (PCOSP) are included for consensus-based meta-clustering and overall-survival prediction, respectively. Additionally, four published subtype classifiers and three published prognostic gene signatures are included to allow users to easily recreate published results, apply existing classifiers to new data, and benchmark the relative performance of new methods. The use of existing Bioconductor classes as input to all PDATK classes and methods enables integration with existing Bioconductor datasets, including the 21 pancreatic cancer patient cohorts available in the MetaGxPancreas data package. PDATK has been used to replicate results from Sandhu et al (2019) [https://doi.org/10.1200/cci.18.00102] and an additional paper is in the works using CSPC to validate subtypes from the included published classifiers, both of which use the data available in MetaGxPancreas. The inclusion of subtype centroids and prognostic gene signatures from these and other publications will enable researchers and clinicians to classify novel patient gene expression data, allowing the direct clinical application of the classifiers included in PDATK. Overall, PDATK provides a rich set of tools to identify and validate useful prognostic and molecular subtypes based on gene-expression data, benchmark new classifiers against existing ones, and apply discovered classifiers on novel patient data to inform clinical decision making.\n",

      "Protein Group Code Algorithm (PGCA) is a computationally inexpensive algorithm to merge protein summaries from multiple experimental quantitative proteomics data. The algorithm connects two or more groups with overlapping accession numbers. In some cases, pairwise groups are mutually exclusive but they may still be connected by another group (or set of groups) with overlapping accession numbers. Thus, groups created by PGCA from multiple experimental runs (i.e., global groups) are called \"connected\" groups. These identified global protein groups enable the analysis of quantitative data available for protein groups instead of unique protein identifiers.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "SCATE is a software tool for extracting and enhancing the sparse and discrete Single-cell ATAC-seq Signal. Single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) is the state-of-the-art technology for analyzing genome-wide regulatory landscapes in single cells. Single-cell ATAC-seq data are sparse and noisy, and analyzing such data is challenging. Existing computational methods cannot accurately reconstruct activities of individual cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in individual cells or rare cell subpopulations. SCATE was developed to adaptively integrate information from co-activated CREs, similar cells, and publicly available regulome data and substantially increase the accuracy for estimating activities of individual CREs. We demonstrate that SCATE can be used to better reconstruct the regulatory landscape of a heterogeneous sample.\n",

      "This is a probabilistic modelling pipeline for computing per- nucleotide posterior probabilities of modification from the data collected in structure probing experiments. The model supports multiple experimental replicates and empirically corrects coverage- and sequence-dependent biases. The model utilises the measure of a \"drop-off rate\" for each nucleotide, which is compared between replicates through a log-ratio (LDR). The LDRs between control replicates define a null distribution of variability in drop-off rate observed by chance and LDRs between treatment and control replicates gets compared to this distribution. Resulting empirical p-values (probability of being \"drawn\" from the null distribution) are used as observations in a Hidden Markov Model with a Beta-Uniform Mixture model used as an emission model. The resulting posterior probabilities indicate the probability of a nucleotide of having being modified in a structure probing experiment.\n",

BUSseq is able to simultaneously correct batch effects, clusters cell types, and takes care of the count data nature, the overdispersion, the dropout events, and the cell-specific sequencing depth of scRNA-seq data. After correcting the batch effects with BUSseq, the corrected value can be used for downstream analysis as if all cells were sequenced in a single batch. BUSseq can integrate read count matrices obtained from different scRNA-seq platforms and allow cell types to be measured in some but not all of the batches as long as the experimental design fulfills the conditions listed in our manuscript.\n",

The scores can then be used to rank and select the top n most promising genes for downstream experiments.\n",

      "Statistical and computational method to analyze the co-expression of gene pairs at single cell level. It provides the foundation for single-cell gene interactome analysis. The basic idea is studying the zero UMI counts' distribution instead of focusing on positive counts; this is done with a generalized contingency tables framework. COTAN can effectively assess the correlated or anti-correlated expression of gene pairs. It provides a numerical index related to the correlation and an approximate p-value for the associated independence test. COTAN can also evaluate whether single genes are differentially expressed, scoring them with a newly defined global differentiation index. Moreover, this approach provides ways to plot and cluster genes according to their co-expression pattern with other genes, effectively helping the study of gene interactions and becoming a new tool to identify cell-identity marker genes.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Director is an R package designed to streamline the visualization of molecular effects in regulatory cascades. It utilizes the R package htmltools and a modified Sankey plugin of the JavaScript library D3 to provide a fast and easy, browser-enabled solution to discovering potentially interesting downstream effects of regulatory and/or co-expressed molecules. The diagrams are robust, interactive, and packaged as highly-portable HTML files that eliminate the need for third-party software to view. This enables a straightforward approach for scientists to interpret the data produced, and bioinformatics developers an alternative means to present relevant data.\n",

The direct output of our software package is the best sequence of methylation states, eliminating the use of a subjective, and most of the time an arbitrary, threshold of p-value for determining significance. At last, our methodology does not require replication in either or both of the two comparison groups.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "MHC (major histocompatibility complex) molecules are cell surface complexes that present antigens to T cells. The repertoire of antigens presented in a given genetic background largely depends on the sequence of the encoded MHC molecules, and thus, in humans, on the highly variable HLA (human leukocyte antigen) genes of the hyperpolymorphic HLA locus. More than 28,000 different HLA alleles have been reported, with significant differences in allele frequencies between human populations worldwide. Reproducible and consistent annotation of HLA alleles in large-scale bioinformatics workflows remains challenging, because the available reference databases and software tools often use different HLA naming schemes. The package immunotation provides tools for consistent annotation of HLA genes in typical immunoinformatics workflows such as for example the prediction of MHC-presented peptides in different human donors. Converter functions that provide mappings between different HLA naming schemes are based on the MHC restriction ontology (MRO). The package also provides automated access to HLA alleles frequencies in worldwide human reference populations stored in the Allele Frequency Net Database.\n",

For that it takes perturbation data, either steady-state or time-series, as input and generates an LP model which allows the inference of signaling networks. For parameter identification either leave-one-out cross-validation or stratified n-fold cross-validation can be used.\n",

      "An increasing number of microbiome datasets have been generated and analyzed with the help of rapidly developing sequencing technologies. At present, analysis of taxonomic profiling data is mainly conducted using composition-based methods, which ignores interactions between community members. Besides this, a lack of efficient ways to compare microbial interaction networks limited the study of community dynamics. To better understand how community diversity is affected by complex interactions between its members, we developed a framework (Microbial community dIversity and Network Analysis, mina), a comprehensive framework for microbial community diversity analysis and network comparison. By defining and integrating network-derived community features, we greatly reduce noise-to-signal ratio for diversity analyses. A bootstrap and permutation-based method was implemented to assess community network dissimilarities and extract discriminative features in a statistically principled way.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "preciseTAD provides functions to predict the location of boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs) and chromatin loops at base-level resolution. As an input, it takes BED-formatted genomic coordinates of domain boundaries detected from low-resolution Hi-C data, and coordinates of high-resolution genomic annotations from ENCODE or other consortia. preciseTAD employs several feature engineering strategies and resampling techniques to address class imbalance, and trains an optimized random forest model for predicting low-resolution domain boundaries. Translated on a base-level, preciseTAD predicts the probability for each base to be a boundary. Density-based clustering and scalable partitioning techniques are used to detect precise boundary regions and summit points. Compared with low-resolution boundaries, preciseTAD boundaries are highly enriched for CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143 signal and more conserved across cell lines. The pre-trained model can accurately predict boundaries in another cell line using CTCF, RAD21, SMC3, and ZNF143 annotation data for this cell line.\n",

      "Provides an interface to build a unified database of genomic annotations and their coordinates (gene, transcript and exon levels).

Also useful when combinatorial annotation elements are reuired, such as RefSeq coordinates with Ensembl biotypes. Finally, it can download, construct and handle annotations with versioned genes and transcripts (where available, e.g. RefSeq and latest Ensembl). This is particularly useful in precision medicine applications where the latter must be reported.\n",

Bayes factors are calculated at each SNP to determine likelihood of potential loss of heterozygosity event. Two plotting functions are included to visualize allele fraction and aggregated Bayes factor per chromosome. Data generated with the 10X Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression platform must be pre-processed to obtain an individual sample VCF with columns for each cluster. Required fields are allele depth (AD) with counts for reference/alternative alleles and read depth (DP).\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "A fundamental problem in biomedical research is the low number of observations, mostly due to a lack of available biosamples, prohibitive costs, or ethical reasons. By augmenting a few real observations with artificially generated samples, their analysis could lead to more robust and higher reproducible. One possible solution to the problem is the use of generative models, which are statistical models of data that attempt to capture the entire probability distribution from the observations. Using the variational autoencoder (VAE), a well-known deep generative model, this package is aimed to generate samples with gene expression data, especially for single-cell RNA-seq data. Furthermore, the VAE can use conditioning to produce specific cell types or subpopulations. The conditional VAE (CVAE) allows us to create targeted samples rather than completely random ones.\n",

To asses, whether the SNV could potentially influence binding of splicing regulatory proteins VarCon calcualtes the HEXplorer score as an estimation. Besides, VarCon additionally reports splice site strengths of splice sites within the retrieved genomic sequence and any changes due to the SNV.\n",

The current implementation accepts genotype data of a diploid population at any generation of multi-parental cross, e.g. biparental F2 from inbred parents, biparental F2 from outbred parents, and 8-way recombinant inbred lines (8-way RILs) which can be refered to as MAGIC population.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "A statistical framework to examine the combinations of clones that co-exist in tumors. More precisely, the algorithm finds pairs of genes that are mutated in the same tumor but in different clones, i.e. their subclonal mutation profiles are mutually exclusive. We refer to this as clonally exclusive. It means that the mutations occurred in different branches of the tumor phylogeny, indicating parallel evolution of the clones. Our statistical framework assesses whether a pattern of clonal exclusivity occurs more often than expected by chance alone across a cohort of patients. The required input data are the mutated gene-to-clone assignments from a cohort of cancer patients, which were obtained by running phylogenetic tree inference methods. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of a tumor and detecting the clones is challenging. For nondeterministic algorithms, repeated tree inference runs may lead to slightly different mutation-to-clone assignments. Therefore, our algorithm was designed to allow the input of multiple gene-to-clone assignments per patient. They may have been generated by repeatedly performing the tree inference, or by sampling from the posterior distribution of trees. The tree inference methods designate the mutations to individual clones. The mutations can then be mapped to genes or pathways. Hence our statistical framework can be applied on the gene level, or on the pathway level to detect clonally exclusive pairs of pathways. If a pair is significantly clonally exclusive, it points towards the fact that this specific clone configuration confers a selective advantage, possibly through synergies between the clones with these mutations.\n",

The user-friendly plot functions in this package also plot histograms of the reproducibility of features per sample pair and sample pairs per feature. Furthermore, our approach also allows the users to select optimal filtering threshold values for the identification of reproducible features and sample pairs based on output visualization checks (histograms). This package also provides the subset of data filtered by reproducible features and/or sample pairs.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Identifying differentially expressed genes between the same or different species is an urgent demand for biological and medical research. For RNA-seq data, systematic technical effects and different sequencing depths are usually encountered when conducting experiments. Normalization is regarded as an essential step in the discovery of biologically important changes in expression. The present methods usually involve normalization of the data with a scaling factor, followed by detection of significant genes. However, more than one scaling factor may exist because of the complexity of real data. Consequently, methods that normalize data by a single scaling factor may deliver suboptimal performance or may not even work. The development of modern machine learning techniques has provided a new perspective regarding discrimination between differentially expressed (DE) and non-DE genes. However, in reality, the non-DE genes comprise only a small set and may contain housekeeping genes (in same species) or conserved orthologous genes (in different species). Therefore, the process of detecting DE genes can be formulated as a one-class classification problem, where only non-DE genes are observed, while DE genes are completely absent from the training data. We transform the problem to an outlier detection problem by treating DE genes as outliers, and we propose a normalization-invariant minimum enclosing ball (NIMEB) method to construct a smallest possible ball to contain the known non-DE genes in a feature space. The genes outside the minimum enclosing ball can then be naturally considered to be DE genes. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed NIMEB method does not require data normalization, which is particularly attractive when the RNA-seq data include more than one scaling factor. Furthermore, the NIMEB method could be easily extended to different species without normalization.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Relative transcript abundance has proven to be a valuable tool for understanding the function of genes in biological systems. For the differential analysis of transcript abundance using RNA sequencing data, the negative binomial model is by far the most frequently adopted. However, common methods that are based on a negative binomial model are not robust to extreme outliers, which we found to be abundant in public datasets. So far, no rigorous and probabilistic methods for detection of outliers have been developed for RNA sequencing data, leaving the identification mostly to visual inspection. Recent advances in Bayesian computation allow large-scale comparison of observed data against its theoretical distribution given in a statistical model. Here we propose ppcseq, a key quality-control tool for identifying transcripts that include outlier data points in differential expression analysis, which do not follow a negative binomial distribution. Applying ppcseq to analyse several publicly available datasets using popular tools, we show that from 3 to 10 percent of differentially abundant transcripts across algorithms and datasets had statistics inflated by the presence of outliers.\n",

The functional regulatory variant status then influences whether nearby genes are likely to display outlier levels of gene expression in that person.

      "RNA-sense tool compares RNA-seq time curves in two experimental conditions, i.e. wild-type and mutant, and works in three steps. At Step 1, it builds expression profile for each transcript in one condition (i.e. wild-type) and tests if the transcript abundance grows or decays significantly. Dynamic transcripts are then sorted to non-overlapping groups (time profiles) by the time point of switch up or down. At Step 2, RNA-sense outputs the groups of differentially expressed transcripts, which are up- or downregulated in the mutant compared to the wild-type at each time point. At Step 3, Correlations (Fisher's exact test) between the outputs of Step 1 (switch up- and switch down- time profile groups) and the outputs of Step2 (differentially expressed transcript groups) are calculated. The results of the correlation analysis are printed as two-dimensional color plot, with time profiles and differential expression groups at y- and x-axis, respectively, and facilitates the biological interpretation of the data.\n",

We developed treekoR to: Derive a hierarchical tree structure of cell clusters; quantify a cell types as a proportion relative to all cells in a sample (%total), and, as the proportion relative to a parent population (%parent); perform significance testing using the calculated proportions; and provide an interactive html visualisation to help highlight key results.\n",

We believe individual-level expression patterns of pre-defined pathways or gene sets are better biomarkers than single genes. In this study, we devised a computational method named iPath to identify prognostic biomarker pathways, one sample at a time. To test its utility, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis across 14 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and demonstrated that iPath is capable of identifying highly predictive biomarkers for clinical outcomes, including overall survival, tumor subtypes, and tumor stage classifications. We found that pathway-based biomarkers are more robust and effective than single genes.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "RNA degradation is monitored through measurement of RNA abundance after inhibiting RNA synthesis. This package has functions and example scripts to facilitate (1) data normalization, (2) data modeling using constant decay rate or time-dependent decay rate models, (3) the evaluation of treatment or genotype effects, and (4) plotting of the data and models. Data Normalization: functions and scripts make easy the normalization to the initial (T0) RNA abundance, as well as a method to correct for artificial inflation of Reads per Million (RPM) abundance in global assessments as the total size of the RNA pool decreases. Modeling: Normalized data is then modeled using maximum likelihood to fit parameters. For making treatment or genotype comparisons (up to four), the modeling step models all possible treatment effects on each gene by repeating the modeling with constraints on the model parameters (i.e., the decay rate of treatments A and B are modeled once with them being equal and again allowing them to both vary independently). Model Selection: The AICc value is calculated for each model, and the model with the lowest AICc is chosen. Modeling results of selected models are then compiled into a single data frame. Graphical Plotting: functions are provided to easily visualize decay data model, or half-life distributions using ggplot2 package functions.\n",

SArKS smooths over sequence similarity, quantified by location within a suffix array based on the full set of input sequences. A second round of smoothing over spatial proximity within sequences reveals multi-motif domains. Discovered motifs can then be merged or extended based on adjacency within MMDs. False positive rates are estimated and controlled by permutation testing.\n",

      "We present a novel statistical framework for identifying differential distributions in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data between treatment conditions by modeling gene expression read counts using generalized linear models (GLMs). We model each gene independently under each treatment condition using error distributions Poisson (P), Negative Binomial (NB), Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and Zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) with log link function and model based normalization for differences in sequencing depth. Since all four distributions considered in our framework belong to the same family of distributions, we first perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to select genes belonging to the family of ZINB distributions. Genes passing the KS test will be then modeled using GLMs. Model selection is done by calculating the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic.\n",

Wrapper functions are provided for visualizing cluster architectures as sequence logos.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Cell surface proteins form a major fraction of the druggable proteome and can be used for tissue-specific delivery of oligonucleotide/cell-based therapeutics. Alternatively spliced surface protein isoforms have been shown to differ in their subcellular localization and/or their transmembrane (TM) topology. Surface proteins are hydrophobic and remain difficult to study thereby necessitating the use of TM topology prediction methods such as TMHMM and Phobius. However, there exists a need for bioinformatic approaches to streamline batch processing of isoforms for comparing and visualizing topologies. To address this gap, we have developed an R package, surfaltr. It pairs inputted isoforms, either known alternatively spliced or novel, with their APPRIS annotated principal counterparts, predicts their TM topologies using TMHMM or Phobius, and generates a customizable graphical output. Further, surfaltr facilitates the prioritization of biologically diverse isoform pairs through the incorporation of three different ranking metrics and through protein alignment functions. Citations for programs mentioned here can be found in the vignette.\n",

      "Synapsis is a Bioconductor software package for automated (unbiased and reproducible) analysis of meiotic immunofluorescence datasets. The primary functions of the software can i) identify cells in meiotic prophase that are labelled by a synaptonemal complex axis or central element protein, ii) isolate individual synaptonemal complexes and measure their physical length, iii) quantify foci and co-localise them with synaptonemal complexes, iv) measure interference between synaptonemal complex-associated foci. The software has applications that extend to multiple species and to the analysis of other proteins that label meiotic prophase chromosomes. The software converts meiotic immunofluorescence images into R data frames that are compatible with machine learning methods. Given a set of microscopy images of meiotic spread slides, synapsis crops images around individual single cells, counts colocalising foci on strands on a per cell basis, and measures the distance between foci on any given strand.\n",

Of note, CONCLUS does not cover the preprocessing steps of sequencing files obtained following next-generation sequencing. CONCLUS is organized into the following steps: Generation of multiple t-SNE plots with a range of parameters including different selection of genes extracted from PCA. Use the Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm for idenfication of clusters in each generated t-SNE plot. All DBSCAN results are combined into a cell similarity matrix. The cell similarity matrix is used to define \"CONSENSUS\" clusters conserved accross the previously defined clustering solutions. Identify marker genes for each concensus cluster.\n",

      "PaIRKAT is model framework for assessing statistical relationships between networks of metabolites (pathways) and an outcome of interest (phenotype). PaIRKAT queries the KEGG database to determine interactions between metabolites from which network connectivity is constructed. This model framework improves testing power on high dimensional data by including graph topography in the kernel machine regression setting. Studies on high dimensional data can struggle to include the complex relationships between variables. The semi-parametric kernel machine regression model is a powerful tool for capturing these types of relationships. They provide a framework for testing for relationships between outcomes of interest and high dimensional data such as metabolomic, genomic, or proteomic pathways. PaIRKAT uses known biological connections between high dimensional variables by representing them as edges of âgraphsâ or ânetworks.â It is common for nodes (e.g. metabolites) to be disconnected from all others within the graph, which leads to meaningful decreases in testing power whether or not the graph information is included. We include a graph regularization or âsmoothingâ approach for managing this issue.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Mutations that rapidly accumulate in viral genomes during a pandemic can be used to track the evolution of the virus and, accordingly, unravel the viral infection network. To this extent, sequencing samples of the virus can be employed to estimate models from genomic epidemiology and may serve, for instance, to estimate the proportion of undetected infected people by uncovering cryptic transmissions, as well as to predict likely trends in the number of infected, hospitalized, dead and recovered people. VERSO is an algorithmic framework that processes variants profiles from viral samples to produce phylogenetic models of viral evolution. The approach solves a Boolean Matrix Factorization problem with phylogenetic constraints, by maximizing a log-likelihood function. VERSO includes two separate and subsequent steps; in this package we provide an R implementation of VERSO STEP 1.\n",

      "The PoTRA analysis is based on topological ranks of genes in biological pathways. PoTRA can be used to detect pathways involved in disease (Li, Liu & Dinu, 2018). We use PageRank to measure the relative topological ranks of genes in each biological pathway, then select hub genes for each pathway, and use Fishers Exact test to determine if the number of hub genes in each pathway is altered from normal to cancer (Li, Liu & Dinu, 2018). Alternatively, if the distribution of topological ranks of gene in a pathway is altered between normal and cancer, this pathway might also be involved in cancer (Li, Liu & Dinu, 2018). Hence, we use the KolmogorovâSmirnov test to detect pathways that have an altered distribution of topological ranks of genes between two phenotypes (Li, Liu & Dinu, 2018). PoTRA can be used with the KEGG, Reactome, SMPDB and PharmGKB, Panther, PathBank, etc databases from the devel graphite library.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "DifferentialRegulation is a method for detecting differentially regulated genes between two groups of samples (e.g., healthy vs. disease, or treated vs. untreated samples), by targeting differences in the balance of spliced and unspliced mRNA abundances, obtained from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. DifferentialRegulation accounts for the sample-to-sample variability, and embeds multiple samples in a Bayesian hierarchical model. In particular, when reads are compatible with multiple genes or multiple splicing versions of a gene (unspliced spliced or ambiguous), the method allocates these multi-mapping reads to the gene of origin and their splicing version. Parameters are inferred via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques (Metropolis-within-Gibbs).\n",

This \"top scoring pair\" maximizes the average of sensitivity and specificity over all rank based classifiers using a pair of genes in the data set. The advantage of classifying samples based on only the relative rank of a pair of genes is (a) the classifiers are much simpler and often more interpretable than more complicated classification schemes and (b) if arrays can be classified using only a pair of genes, PCR based tests could be used for classification of samples.

      "Collection of various measures and tools for lncRNA annotation prediction put inside a redistributable R package. The package contains two main algorithms; lncRNA2GOA and TopoICSim. lncRNA2GOA tries to annotate novel genes (in this specific case lncRNAs) by using various correlation/geometric scoring methods on correlated expression data. After correlating/scoring, the results are annotated and enriched. TopoICSim is a topologically based method, that compares gene similarity based on the topology of the GO DAG by information content (IC) between GO terms.\n",

      "The IsoGene Graphical User Interface (IsoGene-GUI) is a user friendly interface of the IsoGene package which is aimed to identify for genes with a monotonic trend in the expression levels with respect to the increasing doses. Additionally, GUI extension of original package contains various tools to perform clustering of dose-response profiles. Testing is addressed through several test statistics: global likelihood ratio test (E2), Bartholomew 1961, Barlow et al. 1972 and Robertson et al. 1988), Williams (1971, 1972), Marcus (1976), the M (Hu et al. 2005) and the modified M (Lin et al. 2007). The p-values of the global likelihood ratio test (E2) are obtained using the exact distribution and permutations. The other four test statistics are obtained using permutations. Several p-values adjustment are provided: Bonferroni, Holm (1979), Hochberg (1988), and Sidak procedures for controlling the family-wise Type I error rate (FWER), and BH (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) and BY (Benjamini and Yekutieli 2001) procedures are used for controlling the FDR. The inference is based on resampling methods, which control the False Discovery Rate (FDR), for both permutations (Ge et al., 2003) and the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM, Tusher et al., 2001). Clustering methods are outsourced from CRAN packages ORCME, ORIClust. The package ORCME is based on delta-clustering method (Cheng and Church, 2000) and ORIClust on Order Restricted Information Criterion (Liu et al., 2009), both perform same task but from different perspective and their outputs are clusters of genes. Additionally, profile selection for given gene based on Generalized ORIC (Kuiper et al., 2014) from package goric and permutation test for E2 based on package orQA are included in IsoGene-GUI. None of these four packages has GUI.\n",

      "The MACPET package can be used for complete interaction analysis for ChIA-PET data. MACPET reads ChIA-PET data in BAM or SAM format and separates the data into Self-ligated, Intra- and Inter-chromosomal PETs. Furthermore, MACPET breaks the genome into regions and applies 2D mixture models for identifying candidate peaks/binding sites using skewed generalized students-t distributions (SGT). It then uses a local poisson model for finding significant binding sites. Finally it runs an additive interaction-analysis model for calling for significant interactions between those peaks. MACPET is mainly written in C++, and it also supports the BiocParallel package.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "omicsViewer visualizes ExpressionSet (or SummarizedExperiment) in an interactive way. The omicsViewer has a separate back- and front-end. In the back-end, users need to prepare an ExpressionSet that contains all the necessary information for the downstream data interpretation. Some extra requirements on the headers of phenotype data or feature data are imposed so that the provided information can be clearly recognized by the front-end, at the same time, keep a minimum modification on the existing ExpressionSet object. The pure dependency on R/Bioconductor guarantees maximum flexibility in the statistical analysis in the back-end. Once the ExpressionSet is prepared, it can be visualized using the front-end, implemented by shiny and plotly. Both features and samples could be selected from (data) tables or graphs (scatter plot/heatmap). Different types of analyses, such as enrichment analysis (using Bioconductor package fgsea or fisher's exact test) and STRING network analysis, will be performed on the fly and the results are visualized simultaneously. When a subset of samples and a phenotype variable is selected, a significance test on means (t-test or ranked based test; when phenotype variable is quantitative) or test of independence (chi-square or fisherâs exact test; when phenotype data is categorical) will be performed to test the association between the phenotype of interest with the selected samples. Additionally, other analyses can be easily added as extra shiny modules. Therefore, omicsViewer will greatly facilitate data exploration, many different hypotheses can be explored in a short time without the need for knowledge of R. In addition, the resulting data could be easily shared using a shiny server. Otherwise, a standalone version of omicsViewer together with designated omics data could be easily created by integrating it with portable R, which can be shared with collaborators or submitted as supplementary data together with a manuscript.\n",

      "DepInfeR integrates two experimentally accessible input data matrices: the drug sensitivity profiles of cancer cell lines or primary tumors ex-vivo (X), and the drug affinities of a set of proteins (Y), to infer a matrix of molecular protein dependencies of the cancers (Ã). DepInfeR deconvolutes the protein inhibition effect on the viability phenotype by using regularized multivariate linear regression. It assigns a âdependence coefficientâ to each protein and each sample, and therefore could be used to gain a causal and accurate understanding of functional consequences of genomic aberrations in a heterogeneous disease, as well as to guide the choice of pharmacological intervention for a specific cancer type, sub-type, or an individual patient.

      "Description:\n",
      "Generative modeling for protein engineering is key to solving fundamental problems in synthetic biology, medicine, and material science. Machine learning has enabled us to generate useful protein sequences on a variety of scales. Generative models are machine learning methods which seek to model the distribution underlying the data, allowing for the generation of novel samples with similar properties to those on which the model was trained. Generative models of proteins can learn biologically meaningful representations helpful for a variety of downstream tasks. Furthermore, they can learn to generate protein sequences that have not been observed before and to assign higher probability to protein sequences that satisfy desired criteria. In this package, common deep generative models for protein sequences, such as variational autoencoder (VAE), generative adversarial networks (GAN), and autoregressive models are available. In the VAE and GAN, the Word2vec is used for embedding. The transformer encoder is applied to protein sequences for the autoregressive model.\n",

      "This package brings the GenoMetric Query Language (GMQL) functionalities into the R environment. GMQL is a high-level, declarative language to manage heterogeneous genomic datasets for biomedical purposes, using simple queries to process genomic regions and their metadata and properties. GMQL adopts algorithms efficiently designed for big data using cloud-computing technologies (like Apache Hadoop and Spark) allowing GMQL to run on modern infrastructures, in order to achieve scalability and high performance. It allows to create, manipulate and extract genomic data from different data sources both locally and remotely. Our RGMQL functions allow complex queries and processing leveraging on the R idiomatic paradigm. The RGMQL package also provides a rich set of ancillary classes that allow sophisticated input/output management and sorting, such as: ASC, DESC, BAG, MIN, MAX, SUM, AVG, MEDIAN, STD, Q1, Q2, Q3 (and many others). Note that many RGMQL functions are not directly executed in R environment, but are deferred until real execution is issued.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Macarron is a workflow for the prioritization of potentially bioactive metabolites from metabolomics experiments. Prioritization integrates strengths of evidences of bioactivity such as covariation with a known metabolite, abundance relative to a known metabolite and association with an environmental or phenotypic indicator of bioactivity. Broadly, the workflow consists of stratified clustering of metabolic spectral features which co-vary in abundance in a condition, transfer of functional annotations, estimation of relative abundance and differential abundance analysis to identify associations between features and phenotype/condition.\n",

      "SpotClean is a computational method to adjust for spot swapping in spatial transcriptomics data. Recent spatial transcriptomics experiments utilize slides containing thousands of spots with spot-specific barcodes that bind mRNA. Ideally, unique molecular identifiers at a spot measure spot-specific expression, but this is often not the case due to bleed from nearby spots, an artifact we refer to as spot swapping. SpotClean is able to estimate the contamination rate in observed data and decontaminate the spot swapping effect, thus increase the sensitivity and precision of downstream analyses.\n",

      "'rifi' analyses data from rifampicin time series created by microarray or RNAseq. 'rifi' is a transcriptome data analysis tool for the holistic identification of transcription and decay associated processes. The decay constants and the delay of the onset of decay is fitted for each probe/bin. Subsequently, probes/bins of equal properties are combined into segments by dynamic programming, independent of a existing genome annotation. This allows to detect transcript segments of different stability or transcriptional events within one annotated gene. In addition to the classic decay constant/half-life analysis, 'rifi' detects processing sites, transcription pausing sites, internal transcription start sites in operons, sites of partial transcription termination in operons, identifies areas of likely transcriptional interference by the collision mechanism and gives an estimate of the transcription velocity. All data are integrated to give an estimate of continous transcriptional units, i.e. operons. Comprehensive output tables and visualizations of the full genome result and the individual fits for all probes/bins are produced.\n",

      "The R package CTSV implements the CTSV approach developed by Jinge Yu and Xiangyu Luo that detects cell-type-specific spatially variable genes accounting for excess zeros. CTSV directly models sparse raw count data through a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model, incorporates cell-type proportions, and performs hypothesis testing based on R package pscl. The package outputs p-values and q-values for genes in each cell type, and CTSV is scalable to datasets with tens of thousands of genes measured on hundreds of spots. CTSV can be installed in Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.\n",

      "Reads and fragments aligned to splice junctions can be used to quantify alternative splicing events (ASE). However, overlapping ASEs can confound their quantification. SpliceWiz quantifies ASEs, calculating percent-spliced-in (PSI) using junction reads, and intron retention using IRFinder-based quantitation. Novel filters identify ASEs that are relatively less confounded by overlapping events, whereby PSIs can be calculated with higher confidence. SpliceWiz is ultra-fast, using multi-threaded processing of BAM files. It can be run using a graphical user or command line interfaces. GUI-based interactive visualization of differential ASEs, including novel group-based RNA-seq coverage visualization, simplifies short-read RNA-seq analysis in R.\n",

ATACseqTFEA not only uses the difference of open region information, but also (or emphasizes) the difference of TFs footprints (cutting sites or insertion sites). ATACseqTFEA provides an easy, rigorous way to broadly assess TF activity changes between two conditions.\n",

This allows for the features of cells such as marker expression and morphology to be extracted, stored and analysed. simpleSeg provides functionality for user friendly, watershed based segmentation on multiplexed cellular images in R based on the intensity of user specified protein marker channels. simpleSeg can also be used for the normalization of single cell data obtained from multiple images.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "The 'phenomis' package provides methods to perform post-processing (i.e. quality control and normalization) as well as univariate statistical analysis of single and multi-omics data sets. These methods include quality control metrics, signal drift and batch effect correction, intensity transformation, univariate hypothesis testing, but also clustering (as well as annotation of metabolomics data). The data are handled in the standard Bioconductor formats (i.e. SummarizedExperiment and MultiAssayExperiment for single and multi-omics datasets, respectively; the alternative ExpressionSet and MultiDataSet formats are also supported for convenience). As a result, all methods can be readily chained as workflows. The pipeline can be further enriched by multivariate analysis and feature selection, by using the 'ropls' and 'biosigner' packages, which support the same formats. Data can be conveniently imported from and exported to text files. Although the methods were initially targeted to metabolomics data, most of the methods can be applied to other types of omics data (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics).\n",

      "High-throughput single-cell measurements of DNA methylomes can quantify methylation heterogeneity and uncover its role in gene regulation. However, technical limitations and sparse coverage can preclude this task. scMET is a hierarchical Bayesian model which overcomes sparsity, sharing information across cells and genomic features to robustly quantify genuine biological heterogeneity. scMET can identify highly variable features that drive epigenetic heterogeneity, and perform differential methylation and variability analyses. We illustrate how scMET facilitates the characterization of epigenetically distinct cell populations and how it enables the formulation of novel hypotheses on the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.\n",

EpiMix incorporates specialized algorithms to identify functional DNA methylation at various genetic elements, including proximal cis-regulatory elements of protein-coding genes, distal enhancers, and genes encoding microRNAs and lncRNAs.\n",

      "OCTAD provides a platform for virtually screening compounds targeting precise cancer patient groups. The essential idea is to identify drugs that reverse the gene expression signature of disease by tamping down over-expressed genes and stimulating weakly expressed ones. The package offers deep-learning based reference tissue selection, disease gene expression signature creation, pathway enrichment analysis, drug reversal potency scoring, cancer cell line selection, drug enrichment analysis and in silico hit validation. It currently covers ~20,000 patient tissue samples covering 50 cancer types, and expression profiles for ~12,000 distinct compounds.\n",

      "Symptomatic heterogeneity in complex diseases reveals differences in molecular states that need to be investigated. However, selecting the numerous parameters of an exploratory clustering analysis in RNA profiling studies requires deep understanding of machine learning and extensive computational experimentation. Tools that assist with such decisions without prior field knowledge are nonexistent and further gene association analyses need to be performed independently. We have developed a suite of tools to automate these processes and make robust unsupervised clustering of transcriptomic data more accessible through automated machine learning based functions. The efficiency of each tool was tested with four datasets characterised by different expression signal strengths. Our toolkitâs decisions reflected the real number of stable partitions in datasets where the subgroups are discernible. Even in datasets with less clear biological distinctions, stable subgroups with different expression profiles and clinical associations were found.\n",

      "Cancer is a genetic disease caused by somatic mutations in genes controlling key biological functions such as cellular growth and division. Such mutations may arise both through cell-intrinsic and exogenous processes, generating characteristic mutational patterns over the genome named mutational signatures. The study of mutational signatures have become a standard component of modern genomics studies, since it can reveal which (environmental and endogenous) mutagenic processes are active in a tumor, and may highlight markers for therapeutic response. Mutational signatures computational analysis presents many pitfalls. First, the task of determining the number of signatures is very complex and depends on heuristics. Second, several signatures have no clear etiology, casting doubt on them being computational artifacts rather than due to mutagenic processes. Last, approaches for signatures assignment are greatly influenced by the set of signatures used for the analysis. To overcome these limitations, we developed RESOLVE (Robust EStimation Of mutationaL signatures Via rEgularization), a framework that allows the efficient extraction and assignment of mutational signatures. RESOLVE implements a novel algorithm that enables (i) the efficient extraction, (ii) exposure estimation, and (iii) confidence assessment during the computational inference of mutational signatures.\n",

      "Description:\n",
      "Have you ever index sorted cells in a 96 or 384-well plate and then sequenced using Sanger sequencing? If so, you probably had some struggles to either check the electropherogram of each cell sequenced manually, or when you tried to identify which cell was sorted where after sequencing the plate. Scifer was developed to solve this issue by performing basic quality control of Sanger sequences and merging flow cytometry data from probed single-cell sorted B cells with sequencing data. scifer can export summary tables, 'fasta' files, electropherograms for visual inspection, and generate reports.\n",

      "stJoincount, the application of join count analysis to the spatial transcriptomics dataset. This tool converts the spatial map into a raster object (a two-dimensional image as a rectangular matrix or grid of square pixels), where clusters labelled spots are converted to adjacent pixels with a calculated resolution. A neighbors' list was created based on the rasterized sample, which identifies adjacent and diagonal neighbors for each pixel. After adding binary spatial weights to the neighbors' list, a multi-categorical join count analysis is then performed, allowing all possible combinations of cluster pairings to be tabulated. The function returns the observed join counts, the expected count under conditions of spatial randomness, and the variance of observed to expected calculated under non-free sampling. The z-score is then calculated as the difference between observed and expected counts, divided by the square root of the variance.\n",
