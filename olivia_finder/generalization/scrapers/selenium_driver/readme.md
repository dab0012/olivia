# ABOUT THE DRIVERS

Selenium is a test automation library used to control a web browser and emulate human interaction with a web page. To interact with the browser, Selenium uses a browser-specific "driver" that provides an API to programmatically control the browser.

In other words, a Selenium driver is a component that acts as a bridge between Selenium and the browser that is being automated. The driver allows Selenium to send commands to the browser and receive information about its state.

## Geckodriver

Geckodriver is a specific driver for the Firefox browser that is used with Selenium. Geckodriver is required to automate Firefox with Selenium, as it provides an API that Selenium can use to control the browser.

Geckodriver is an executable that must be downloaded and installed on your system before Selenium can use it. The executable is specific to each operating system and must be compatible with the version of the Firefox browser being used.

You can download it from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
