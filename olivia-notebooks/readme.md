Introduction
------------

This section aims to show the process of data analysis and visualization carried out within the framework of this Final Degree Project (TFG). In particular, it is based on the use of the notebooks developed in a previous TFG, but with the incorporation of new data generated in this TFG.

Description
-----------

This section presents a series of notebooks that show the data analysis and visualization process carried out within the framework of this TFG. Specifically, the notebooks developed in a previous TFG have been used, but new data generated in this TFG have been incorporated, which allows expanding the research and demonstrating the validity and scalability of the approach used.

The new data includes up-to-date data and package repositories, making it possible to assess the performance and generalizability of the proposed models in a more up-to-date and realistic environment.

Conclusions
------------

In short, this section makes it possible to demonstrate the value of notebooks for data analysis and visualization, as well as their ability to be reused and expanded in new projects. In addition, it shows how the incorporation of new data can improve the validity and relevance of the research carried out.

We hope that this section will be useful for future research projects in the field of data analysis, and that it can serve as a starting point for new ideas and approaches.
